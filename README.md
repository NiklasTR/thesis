# MD thesis

This thesis comprises two major publications:
* [The drug-induced phenotypic landscape of colorectal cancer organoids](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30722-9)
* A still unpublished manuscript on image based profiling of genetically engineered mouse colon organoids and how this approach can be used to map treatment induced phenotypes to a treatment's molecular mechanisms.
