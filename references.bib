	abstract = {Abstract Wnt pathways are important for the modulation of tissue homeostasis, and their deregulation is linked to cancer development. Canonical Wnt signaling is hyperactivated in many human colorectal cancers due to genetic alterations of the negative Wnt regulator APC. However, the expression levels of Wnt-dependent targets vary between tumors, and the mechanisms of carcinogenesis concomitant with this Wnt signaling dosage have not been understood. In this study, we integrate whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screens with large-scale multi-omic data to delineate functional subtypes of cancer. We engineer APC loss-of-function mutations and thereby hyperactivate Wnt signaling in cells with low endogenous Wnt activity and find that the resulting engineered cells have an unfavorable metabolic equilibrium compared with cells which naturally acquired Wnt hyperactivation. We show that the dosage level of oncogenic Wnt hyperactivation impacts the metabolic equilibrium and the mitochondrial phenotype of a given cell type in a context-dependent manner. These findings illustrate the impact of context-dependent genetic interactions on cellular phenotypes of a central cancer driver mutation and expand our understanding of quantitative modulation of oncogenic signaling in tumorigenesis.},

Organoids closely recapitulate several properties of the original tumor. The spectrum of genetic changes within the "living biobank" agrees well with previous large-scale mutational analyses of CRC. Gene expression analysis indicates that the major CRC molecular subtypes are represented. Tumor organoids are amenable to high-throughput drug screens allowing detection of gene-drug associations. As an example, a single organoid culture was exquisitely sensitive to Wnt secretion (porcupine) inhibitors and carried a mutation in the negative Wnt feedback regulator RNF43, rather than in APC.

	abstract = {The intestinal epithelium withstands continuous mechanical, chemical and biological insults despite its single-layered, simple epithelial structure. The crypt–villus tissue architecture in combination with rapid cell turnover enables the intestine to act both as a barrier and as the primary site of nutrient uptake. Constant tissue replenishment is fuelled by continuously dividing stem cells that reside at the bottom of crypts. These cells are nurtured and protected by specialized epithelial and mesenchymal cells, and together constitute the intestinal stem cell niche. Intestinal stem cells and early progenitor cells compete for limited niche space and, therefore, the ability to retain or regain stemness. Those cells unable to do so differentiate to one of six different mature cell types and move upwards towards the villus, where they are shed into the intestinal lumen after 3–5 days. In this Review, we discuss the signals, cell types and mechanisms that control homeostasis and regeneration in the intestinal epithelium. We investigate how the niche protects and instructs intestinal stem cells, which processes drive differentiation of mature cells and how imbalance in key signalling pathways can cause human disease.},

It has only recently been possible to extend protein structure prediction to two hundred million cataloged proteins. Characterizing the structures of the exponentially growing billions of protein sequences revealed by large scale gene sequencing experiments would necessitate a breakthrough in the speed of folding. Here we show that direct inference of structure from primary sequence using a large language model enables an order of magnitude speed-up in high resolution structure prediction. Leveraging the insight that language models learn evolutionary patterns across millions of sequences, we train models up to 15B parameters, the largest language model of proteins to date. As the language models are scaled they learn information that enables prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. This results in prediction that is up to 60x faster than state-ofthe-art while maintaining resolution and accuracy. Building on this, we present the ESM Metagenomic Atlas. This is the ﬁrst large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins, with more than 617 million structures. The atlas reveals more than 225 million high conﬁdence predictions, including millions whose structures are novel in comparison with experimentally determined structures, giving an unprecedented view into the vast breadth and diversity of the structures of some of the least understood proteins on earth.},

            We present the results for CAPRI Round 46, the third joint CASP‐CAPRI protein assembly prediction challenge. The Round comprised a total of 20 targets including 14 homo‐oligomers and 6 heterocomplexes. Eight of the homo‐oligomer targets and one heterodimer comprised proteins that could be readily modeled using templates from the Protein Data Bank, often available for the full assembly. The remaining 11 targets comprised 5 homodimers, 3 heterodimers, and two higher‐order assemblies. These were more difficult to model, as their prediction mainly involved “ab‐initio” docking of subunit models derived from distantly related templates. A total of {\textasciitilde}30 CAPRI groups, including 9 automatic servers, submitted on average {\textasciitilde}2000 models per target. About 17 groups participated in the CAPRI scoring rounds, offered for most targets, submitting {\textasciitilde}170 models per target. The prediction performance, measured by the fraction of models of acceptable quality or higher submitted across all predictors groups, was very good to excellent for the nine easy targets. Poorer performance was achieved by predictors for the 11 difficult targets, with medium and high quality models submitted for only 3 of these targets. A similar performance “gap” was displayed by scorer groups, highlighting yet again the unmet challenge of modeling the conformational changes of the protein components that occur upon binding or that must be accounted for in template‐based modeling. Our analysis also indicates that residues in binding interfaces were less well predicted in this set of targets than in previous Rounds, providing useful insights for directions of future improvements.},

Here we unravel the mechanisms that orchestrate both organoid formation and the regeneration of intestinal tissue, using an image-based screen to assay an annotated library of compounds. We generate multivariate feature profiles for hundreds of thousands of organoids to quantitatively describe their phenotypic landscape. We then use these phenotypic fingerprints to infer regulatory genetic interactions, establishing a new approach to the mapping of genetic interactions in an emergent system. This allows us to identify genes that regulate cell-fate transitions and maintain the balance between regeneration and homeostasis, unravelling previously unknown roles for several pathways, among them retinoic acid signalling. We then characterize a crucial role for retinoic acid nuclear receptors in controlling exit from the regenerative state and driving enterocyte differentiation. By combining quantitative imaging with RNA sequencing, we show the role of endogenous retinoic acid metabolism in initiating transcriptional programs that guide the cell-fate transitions of intestinal epithelium, and we identify an inhibitor of the retinoid X receptor that improves intestinal regeneration in vivo.},

Examples include the prediction of properties, the discovery of new reaction pathways, or the design of new molecules. The machine needs to read and write fluently in a chemical language for each of these tasks. Strings are a common tool to represent molecular graphs, and the most popular molecular string representation, SMILES, has powered cheminformatics since the late 1980s. However, in the context of AI and ML in chemistry, SMILES has several shortcomings -- most pertinently, most combinations of symbols lead to invalid results with no valid chemical interpretation. To overcome this issue, a new language for molecules was introduced in 2020 that guarantees 100{\textbackslash}\% robustness: SELFIES (SELF-referencIng Embedded Strings). SELFIES has since simplified and enabled numerous new applications in chemistry. In this manuscript, we look to the future and discuss molecular string representations, along with their respective opportunities and challenges. We propose 16 concrete Future Projects for robust molecular representations. These involve the extension toward new chemical domains, exciting questions at the interface of AI and robust languages and interpretability for both humans and machines. We hope that these proposals will inspire several follow-up works exploiting the full potential of molecular string representations for the future of AI in chemistry and materials science.},

These transformations significantly improve decomposition performance compared to existing methods when there is significant technical variation in the generation of the reference profile and observed bulk expression. Importantly, compared to existing methods, our approach is extremely efficient, making it suitable for the analysis of large genomic datasets that are becoming ubiquitous. When applied to subcutaneous adipose and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex expression datasets with both bulk RNA-seq and snRNA-seq data, Bisque replicates previously reported associations between cell type proportions and measured phenotypes across abundant and rare cell types.

Such networks are often necessary to learn well over graphs with a hierarchical structure or to learn over manifold-valued data encountered in the natural sciences.

In this work, we examine the residual neural network (ResNet) and show how to extend this construction to general Riemannian manifolds in a geometrically principled manner. Originally introduced to help solve the vanishing gradient problem, ResNets have become ubiquitous in machine learning due to their beneficial learning properties, excellent empirical results, and easy-to-incorporate nature when building varied neural networks. We find that our Riemannian ResNets mirror these desirable properties: when compared to existing manifold neural networks designed to learn over hyperbolic space and the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, we outperform both kinds of networks in terms of relevant testing metrics and training dynamics.},

Here we present flow-matching, a new training method for CG force fields that combines the advantages of both methods by leveraging normalizing flows, a generative deep learning method. Flow-matching first trains a normalizing flow to represent the CG probability density, which is equivalent to minimizing the relative entropy without requiring iterative CG simulations. Subsequently, the flow generates samples and forces according to the learned distribution in order to train the desired CG free energy model via force-matching. Even without requiring forces from the all-atom simulations, flow-matching outperforms classical force-matching by an order of magnitude in terms of data efficiency and produces CG models that can capture the folding and unfolding transitions of small proteins.},

Here we investigate structure-based docking of 170 million make-on-demand compounds from 130 well-characterized reactions. The resulting library is diverse, representing over 10.7 million scaffolds that are otherwise unavailable. For each compound in the library, docking against AmpC β-lactamase (AmpC) and the D4 dopamine receptor were simulated. From the top-ranking molecules, 44 and 549 compounds were synthesized and tested for interactions with AmpC and the D4 dopamine receptor, respectively. We found a phenolate inhibitor of AmpC, which revealed a group of inhibitors without known precedent. This molecule was optimized to 77 nM, which places it among the most potent non-covalent AmpC inhibitors known. Crystal structures of this and other AmpC inhibitors confirmed the docking predictions. Against the D4 dopamine receptor, hit rates fell almost monotonically with docking score, and a hit-rate versus score curve predicted that the library contained 453,000 ligands for the D4 dopamine receptor. Of 81 new chemotypes discovered, 30 showed submicromolar activity, including a 180-pM subtype-selective agonist of the D4 dopamine receptor.},

	title = {Are {Multimodal} {Transformers} {Robust} to {Missing} {Modality}?},
	abstract = {Multimodal data collected from the real world are often imperfect due to missing modalities. Therefore multimodal models that are robust against modal-incomplete data are highly preferred. Recently, Transformer models have shown great success in processing multimodal data. However, existing work has been limited to either architecture designs or pre-training strategies; whether Transformer models are naturally robust against missing-modal data has rarely been investigated. In this paper, we present the firstof-its-kind work to comprehensively investigate the behavior of Transformers in the presence of modal-incomplete data. Unsurprising, we find Transformer models are sensitive to missing modalities while different modal fusion strategies will significantly affect the robustness. What surprised us is that the optimal fusion strategy is dataset dependent even for the same Transformer model; there does not exist a universal strategy that works in general cases. Based on these findings, we propose a principle method to improve the robustness of Transformer models by automatically searching for an optimal fusion strategy regarding input data. Experimental validations on three benchmarks support the superior performance of the proposed method.},

We adapt two popular models, namely Vision Transformer and Multiscale Vision Transformers, to reversible variants and benchmark extensively across both model sizes and tasks of image classification, object detection and video classification. Reversible Vision Transformers achieve a reduced memory footprint of up to 15.5× at identical model complexity, parameters and accuracy, demonstrating the promise of reversible vision transformers as an efficient backbone for resource limited training regimes. Finally, we find that the additional computational burden of recomputing activations is more than overcome for deeper models, where throughput can increase up to 3.9× over their non-reversible counterparts.

	abstract = {The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer. The code and models of Graphormer will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Microsoft/Graphormer.},

Cells could be divided into 15 clusters that matched previously characterized cell types: all endocrine cell types, including rare epsilon-cells; exocrine cell types; vascular cells; Schwann cells; quiescent and activated stellate cells; and four types of immune cells. We detected subpopulations of ductal cells with distinct expression profiles and validated their existence with immuno-histochemistry stains. Moreover, among human beta- cells, we detected heterogeneity in the regulation of genes relating to functional maturation and levels of ER stress. Finally, we deconvolved bulk gene expression samples using the single-cell data to detect disease-associated differential expression.

Here, we developed a semi-automated organoid screening method, which we applied to a library of highly specific chemical probes to identify epigenetic regulators of intestinal epithelial biology. The role of epigenetic modifiers in adult stem cell systems, such as the intestinal epithelium, is still undefined. Based on this resource dataset, we identified several targets that affected epithelial cell differentiation, including HDACs, EP300/CREBBP, LSD1, and type I PRMTs, which were verified by complementary methods. For example, we show that inhibiting type I PRMTs, which leads enhanced epithelial differentiation, blocks the growth of adenoma but not normal organoid cultures. Thus, epigenetic probes are powerful tools to study intestinal epithelial biology and may have therapeutic potential.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has achieved tremendous success in recent years. In simple words, deep learning uses the composition of many nonlinear functions to model the complex dependency between input features and labels. While neural networks have a long history, recent advances have greatly improved their performance in computer vision, natural language processing, etc. From the statistical and scientific perspective, it is natural to ask: What is deep learning? What are the new characteristics of deep learning, compared with classical methods? What are the theoretical foundations of deep learning? To answer these questions, we introduce common neural network models (e.g., convolutional neural nets, recurrent neural nets, generative adversarial nets) and training techniques (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, dropout, batch normalization) from a statistical point of view. Along the way, we highlight new characteristics of deep learning (including depth and over-parametrization) and explain their practical and theoretical benefits. We also sample recent results on theories of deep learning, many of which are only suggestive. While a complete understanding of deep learning remains elusive, we hope that our perspectives and discussions serve as a stimulus for new statistical research.},

	abstract = {In this work, we show that Spearman's correlation coefficient test about \$H\_0:{\textbackslash}rho\_s=0\$ found in most statistical software packages is theoretically incorrect and performs poorly when bivariate normality assumptions are not met or the sample size is small. The historical works about these tests make an unverifiable assumption that the approximate bivariate normality of original data justifies using classic approximations. In general, there is common misconception that the tests about \${\textbackslash}rho\_s=0\$ are robust to deviations from bivariate normality. In fact, we found under certain scenarios violation of the bivariate normality assumption has severe effects on type I error control for the most commonly utilized tests. To address this issue, we developed a robust permutation test for testing the general hypothesis \$H\_0: {\textbackslash}rho\_s=0\$. The proposed test is based on an appropriately studentized statistic. We will show that the test is theoretically asymptotically valid in the general setting when two paired variables are uncorrelated but dependent. This desired property was demonstrated across a range of distributional assumptions and sample sizes in simulation studies, where the proposed test exhibits robust type I error control across a variety of settings, even when the sample size is small. We demonstrated the application of this test in real world examples of transcriptomic data of the TCGA breast cancer patients and a data set of PSA levels and age.},

Computational methods have become powerful ever to analyze such complex the data. Thus, recent successes in the improved quality of CPI prediction are due to use of both sophisticated computational techniques and higher quality information in the databases. The goal of this article is to provide reviews of topics related to CPI, such as data, format, representation, to computational models, so that researchers can take full advantages of these resources to develop novel prediction methods. Chemical compounds and protein data from various resources were discussed in terms of data formats and encoding schemes. For the CPI methods, we grouped prediction methods into five categories from traditional machine learning techniques to state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In closing, we discussed emerging machine learning topics to help both experimental and computational scientists leverage the current knowledge and strategies to develop more powerful and accurate CPI prediction methods.},

In this survey paper, we first highlight both clinical needs and technical challenges in medical imaging and describe how emerging trends in deep learning are addressing these issues. We cover the topics of network architecture, sparse and noisy labels, federating learning, interpretability, uncertainty quantification, etc. Then, we present several case studies that are commonly found in clinical practice, including digital pathology and chest, brain, cardiovascular, and abdominal imaging. Rather than presenting an exhaustive literature survey, we instead describe some prominent research highlights related to these case study applications.

RC tumoroids retained molecular features of the tumors from which they were derived, and their ex vivo responses to clinically relevant chemotherapy and radiation treatment correlated with the clinical responses noted in individual patients' tumors. Upon engraftment into murine rectal mucosa, human RC tumoroids gave rise to invasive RC followed by metastasis to lung and liver. Importantly, engrafted tumors displayed the heterogenous sensitivity to chemotherapy observed clinically. Thus, the biology and drug sensitivity of RC clinical isolates can be efficiently interrogated using an organoid-based, ex vivo platform coupled with in vivo endoluminal propagation in animals.},

	abstract = {Strategies to split ventilators to support multiple patients requiring ventilatory support have been proposed and used in emergency cases in which shortages of ventilators cannot otherwise be remedied by production or procurement strategies. However, the current approaches to ventilator sharing lack the ability to individualize ventilation to each patient, measure pulmonary mechanics, and accommodate rebalancing of the airflow when one patient improves or deteriorates, posing safety concerns to patients. Potential cross-contamination, lack of alarms, insufficient monitoring, and inability to adapt to sudden changes in patient status have prevented widespread acceptance of ventilator sharing. We have developed an individualized system for augmenting ventilator efficacy (iSAVE) as a rapidly deployable platform that uses a single ventilator to simultaneously and more safely support two individuals. The iSAVE enables individual-specific volume and pressure control and the rebalancing of ventilation in response to improvement or deterioration in an individual's respiratory status. The iSAVE incorporates mechanisms to measure pulmonary mechanics, mitigate cross-contamination and backflow, and accommodate sudden flow changes due to individual interdependencies within the respiratory circuit. We demonstrate these capacities through validation using closed- and open-circuit ventilators on linear test lungs. We show that the iSAVE can temporarily ventilate two pigs on one ventilator as efficaciously as each pig on its own ventilator. By leveraging off-the-shelf medical components, the iSAVE could rapidly expand the ventilation capacity of health care facilities during emergency situations such as pandemics.},

	abstract = {Exponentially-growing next-generation sequencing data requires high-performance tools and algorithms. Nevertheless, the implementation of high-performance computational genomics software is inaccessible to many scientists because it requires extensive knowledge of low-level software optimization techniques, forcing scientists to resort to high-level software alternatives that are less efficient. Here, we introduce Seq—a Python-based optimization framework that combines the power and usability of high-level languages like Python with the performance of low-level languages like C or C++. Seq allows for shorter, simpler code, is readily usable by a novice programmer, and obtains significant performance improvements over existing languages and frameworks. We showcase and evaluate Seq by implementing seven standard, widely-used applications from all stages of the genomics analysis pipeline, including genome index construction, finding maximal exact matches, long-read alignment and haplotype phasing, and demonstrate its implementations are up to an order of magnitude faster than existing hand-optimized implementations, with just a fraction of the code. By enabling researchers of all backgrounds to easily implement high-performance analysis tools, Seq further opens the door to the democratization and scalability of computational genomics. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {In the recent years, therapeutic use of antibodies has seen a huge growth, due to their inherent proprieties and technological advances in the methods used to study and characterize them. Effective design and engineering of antibodies for therapeutic purposes are heavily dependent on knowledge of the structural principles that regulate antibody-antigen interactions. Several experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, NMR or mutagenesis analysis can be applied, but these are usually expensive and time consuming. Therefore computational approaches like molecular docking may offer a valuable alternative for the characterisation of antibody-antigen complexes. Here we describe a protocol for the prediction of the 3D structure of antibody-antigen complexes using the integrative modelling platform HADDOCK. The protocol consists of: 1) The identification of the antibody residues belonging to the hyper variable loops which are known to be crucial for the binding and can be used to guide the docking; 2) The detailed steps to perform docking with the HADDOCK 2.4 webserver following different strategies depending on the availability of information about epitope residues.},

The complexity of the SASP, typically assessed by a few dozen secreted proteins, has been greatly underestimated, and a small set of factors cannot explain the diverse phenotypes it produces in vivo. Here, we present the “SASP Atlas,” a comprehensive proteomic database of soluble proteins and exosomal cargo SASP factors originating from multiple senescence inducers and cell types. Each profile consists of hundreds of largely distinct proteins but also includes a subset of proteins elevated in all SASPs. Our analyses identify several candidate biomarkers of cellular senescence that overlap with aging markers in human plasma, including Growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), stanniocalcin 1 (STC1), and serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs), which significantly correlated with age in plasma from a human cohort, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Our findings will facilitate the identification of proteins characteristic of senescence-associated phenotypes and catalog potential senescence biomarkers to assess the burden, originating stimulus, and tissue of origin of senescent cells in vivo.},

	abstract = {Advanced ovarian cancers are a leading cause of cancer-related death in women and are currently treated with surgery and chemotherapy. This standard of care is often temporarily successful but exhibits a high rate of relapse, after which, treatment options are few. Here we investigate whether biomarker-guided use of multiple targeted therapies, including small molecules and antibody-drug conjugates, is a viable alternative. A panel of patient-derived ovarian cancer xenografts (PDX), similar in genetics and chemotherapy responsiveness to human tumors, was exposed to 21 monotherapies and combination therapies. Three monotherapies and one combination were found to be active in different subsets of PDX. Analysis of gene expression data identified biomarkers associated with responsiveness to each of the three targeted therapies, none of which directly inhibits an oncogenic driver. While no single treatment had as high a response rate as chemotherapy, nearly 90\% of PDXs were eligible for and responded to at least one biomarker-guided treatment, including tumors resistant to standard chemotherapy. The distribution of biomarker positivity in The Cancer Genome Atlas data suggests the potential for a similar precision approach in human patients. SIGNIFICANCE: This study exploits a panel of patient-derived xenografts to demonstrate that most ovarian tumors can be matched to effective biomarker-guided treatments.},

	abstract = {The existence of tumor heterogeneity and complex carcinogenic mechanisms in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) make the most commonly used TNM staging system unable to well-interpret the prognosis of patients. Using transcriptome profiling and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we constructed an immune signature based on a multivariate Cox analysis (stepwise model). We estimated the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of chemotherapeutic drugs in patients according to the pRRophetic algorithm. Gene-set variation analysis (GSVA) was used to reveal pathway enrichment between groups. Moreover, immune microenvironment landscape was described by single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and CIBERSORT and systematically correlated with genomic of these patients. A prognostic nomogram combining the immune signature and TNM stage to predict the prognosis was developed by multivariate Cox regression. The novel signature with four immune-related genes (MAL, MS4A1, OAS1, and WFDC2) had good robustness, which can accurately distinguish between high- and low-risk patients. Compared with low-risk patients, high-risk patients with a worse prognosis (5-year OS: 46.5 vs. 59.4\%, p = 0.002) could benefit more from immunotherapy and the application of common chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin and paclitaxel (Wilcoxon test, all p {\textless} 0.05). There were significant differences in tumor immune microenvironment and metabolic pathways between the two groups. Additionally, the constructed nomogram had reliable predictive performance with the C-index of 0.725 (95\% CI = 0.668–0.781) in the development set (n = 500), 0.793 (95\% CI = 0.728–0.858) in the internal validation set (n = 250) and 0.679 (95\% CI = 0.644–0.714) in the external validation set (n = 442). The corresponding calibration curves also showed good consistency. To sum up, we developed an immune-related gene signature and comprehensively evaluated LUAD immune landscape and metabolic pathways. Effective differentiation of high- and low-risk patients and accurate construction of nomogram would be helpful to the development of individualized treatment strategies.},

	abstract = {Approximately half of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients experience disease recurrence and metastasis, and these individuals frequently fail to respond to treatment due to their clinical and biological diversity. Here, we aimed to identify a prognostic signature consisting of a small gene group for precisely predicting CRC heterogeneity. We performed transcriptomic profiling using RNA-seq data generated from the primary tissue samples of 130 CRC patients. A prognostic index (PI) based on recurrence-associated genes was developed and validated in two larger independent CRC patient cohorts (n = 795). The association between the PI and prognosis of CRC patients was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier plots, log-rank tests, a Cox regression analysis and a RT-PCR analysis. Transcriptomic profiling in 130 CRC patients identified two distinct subtypes associated with systemic recurrence. Pathway enrichment and RT-PCR analyses revealed an eleven gene signature incorporated into the PI system, which was a significant prognostic indicator of CRC. Multivariate and subset analyses showed that PI was an independent risk factor (HR = 1.812, 95\% CI = 1.342-2.448, P {\textless} 0.001) with predictive value to identify low-risk stage II patients who responded the worst to adjuvant chemotherapy. Finally, a comparative analysis with previously reported Consensus Molecular Subgroup (CMS), high-risk patients classified by the PI revealed a distinct molecular property similar to CMS4, associated with a poor prognosis. This novel PI predictor based on an eleven gene signature likely represents a surrogate diagnostic tool for identifying high-risk CRC patients and for predicting the worst responding patients for adjuvant chemotherapy.},

We have adapted a method for histological tissue fixation using dithio-bis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP), or Lomant's Reagent, to stabilise cell samples for single-cell transcriptomic applications. DSP is a reversible cross-linker of free amine groups that has previously been shown to preserve tissue integrity for histology while maintaining RNA integrity and yield in bulk RNA extractions. Although RNA-seq data from DSP-fixed single cells appears to be prone to characteristic artefacts, such as slightly reduced yield of cDNA and a detectable 3' bias in comparison with fresh cells, cell preservation using DSP does not appear to substantially reduce RNA complexity at the gene level. In addition, there is evidence that instantaneous fixation of cells can reduce inter-cell technical variability. The ability of DSP-fixed cells to retain commonly used dyes, such as propidium iodide, enables the tracking of experimental sub-populations and the recording of cell viability at the point of fixation. Preserving cells using DSP will remove several barriers in the staging of single-cell experiments, including the transport of samples and the scheduling of shared equipment for downstream single-cell isolation and processing.},

	abstract = {Structure-based docking screens of large compound libraries have become common in early drug and probe discovery. As computer efficiency has improved and compound libraries have grown, the ability to screen hundreds of millions, and even billions, of compounds has become feasible for modest-sized computer clusters. This allows the rapid and cost-effective exploration and categorization of vast chemical space into a subset enriched with potential hits for a given target. To accomplish this goal at speed, approximations are used that result in undersampling of possible configurations and inaccurate predictions of absolute binding energies. Accordingly, it is important to establish controls, as are common in other fields, to enhance the likelihood of success in spite of these challenges. Here we outline best practices and control docking calculations that help evaluate docking parameters for a given target prior to undertaking a large-scale prospective screen, with exemplification in one particular target, the melatonin receptor, where following this procedure led to direct docking hits with activities in the subnanomolar range. Additional controls are suggested to ensure specific activity for experimentally validated hit compounds. These guidelines should be useful regardless of the docking software used. Docking software described in the outlined protocol (DOCK3.7) is made freely available for academic research to explore new hits for a range of targets.},

	abstract = {Suppressing infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will probably require the rapid identification and isolation of individuals infected with the virus on an ongoing basis. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are accurate but costly, which makes the regular testing of every individual expensive. These costs are a challenge for all countries around the world, but particularly for low-to-middle-income countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by pooling (or combining) subsamples and testing them in groups1-7. A balance must be struck between increasing the group size and retaining test sensitivity, as sample dilution increases the likelihood of false-negative test results for individuals with a low viral load in the sampled region at the time of the test8. Similarly, minimizing the number of tests to reduce costs must be balanced against minimizing the time that testing takes, to reduce the spread of the infection. Here we propose an algorithm for pooling subsamples based on the geometry of a hypercube that, at low prevalence, accurately identifies individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a small number of tests and few rounds of testing. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, largely parallel searches are preferred. We report proof-of-concept experiments in which a positive subsample was detected even when diluted 100-fold with negative subsamples (compared with 30-48-fold dilutions described in previous studies9-11). We quantify the loss of sensitivity due to dilution and discuss how it may be mitigated by the frequent re-testing of groups, for example. With the use of these methods, the cost of mass testing could be reduced by a large factor. At low prevalence, the costs decrease in rough proportion to the prevalence. Field trials of our approach are under way in Rwanda and South Africa. The use of group testing on a massive scale to monitor infection rates closely and continually in a population, along with the rapid and effective isolation of people with SARS-CoV-2 infections, provides a promising pathway towards the long-term control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).},

	abstract = {Constraint-based (CB) metabolic models provide a mathematical framework and scaffold for in silico cell metabolism analysis and manipulation. In the past decade, significant efforts have been done to model human metabolism, enabled by the increased availability of multi-omics datasets and curated genome-scale reconstructions, as well as the development of several algorithms for context-specific model (CSM) reconstruction. Although CSM reconstruction has revealed insights on the deregulated metabolism of several pathologies, the process of reconstructing representative models of human tissues still lacks benchmarks and appropriate integrated software frameworks, since many tools required for this process are still disperse across various software platforms, some of which are proprietary. In this work, we address this challenge by assembling a scalable CSM reconstruction pipeline capable of integrating transcriptomics data in CB models. We combined omics preprocessing methods inspired by previous efforts with in-house implementations of existing CSM algorithms and new model refinement and validation routines, all implemented in the Troppo Python-based open-source framework. The pipeline was validated with multi-omics datasets from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), also including reference fluxomics measurements for the MCF7 cell line. We reconstructed over 6000 models based on the Human-GEM template model for 733 cell lines featured in the CCLE, using MCF7 models as reference to find the best parameter combinations. These reference models outperform earlier studies using the same template by comparing gene essentiality and fluxomics experiments. We also analysed the heterogeneity of breast cancer cell lines, identifying key changes in metabolism related to cancer aggressiveness. Despite the many challenges in CB modelling, we demonstrate using our pipeline that combining transcriptomics data in metabolic models can be used to investigate key metabolic shifts. Significant limitations were found on these models ability for reliable quantitative flux prediction, thus motivating further work in genome-wide phenotype prediction. Author summary Genome-scale models of human metabolism are promising tools capable of contextualising large omics datasets within a framework that enables analysis and manipulation of metabolic phenotypes. Despite various successes in applying these methods to provide mechanistic hypotheses for deregulated metabolism in disease, there is no standardized workflow to extract these models using existing methods and the tools required to do so are mostly implemented using proprietary software. We have assembled a generic pipeline to extract and validate context-specific metabolic models using multi-omics datasets and implemented it using the troppo framework. We first validate our pipeline using MCF7 cell line models and assess their ability to predict lethal gene knockouts as well as flux activity using multi-omics data. We also demonstrate how this approach can be generalized for large-scale transcriptomics datasets and used to generate insights on the metabolic heterogeneity of cancer and relevant features for other data mining approaches. The pipeline is available as part of an open-source framework that is generic for a variety of applications. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

	title = {A novel single-cell based method for breast cancer prognosis},
	url = {https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.062794v1},
	abstract = {Breast cancer prognosis is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Various computational methods using bulk RNA-seq data have been proposed for breast cancer prognosis. However, these methods suffer from limited performances or ambiguous biological relevance, as a result of the neglect of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Recently, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged for studying tumor heterogeneity at cellular levels. In this paper, we propose a novel method, scPrognosis , to improve breast cancer prognosis with scRNA-seq data. scPrognosis uses the scRNA-seq data of the biological process Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). It firstly infers the EMT pseudotime and a dynamic gene co-expression network, then uses an integrative model to select genes important in EMT based on their expression variation and differentiation in different stages of EMT, and their roles in the dynamic gene co-expression network. To validate and apply the selected signatures to breast cancer prognosis, we use them as the features to build a prediction model with bulk RNA-seq data. The experimental results show that scPrognosis outperforms other benchmark breast cancer prognosis methods that use bulk RNA-seq data. Moreover, the dynamic changes in the expression of the selected signature genes in EMT may provide clues to the link between EMT and clinical outcomes of breast cancer. scPrognosis will also be useful when applied to scRNA-seq datasets of different biological processes other than EMT. Author summary Various computational methods have been developed for breast cancer prognosis. However, those methods mainly use the gene expression data generated by the bulk RNA sequencing techniques, which average the expression level of a gene across different cell types. As breast cancer is a heterogenous disease, the bulk gene expression may not be the ideal resource for cancer prognosis. In this study, we propose a novel method to improve breast cancer prognosis using scRNA-seq data. The proposed method has been applied to the EMT scRNA-seq dataset for identifying breast cancer signatures for prognosis. In comparison with existing bulk expression data based methods in breast cancer prognosis, our method shows a better performance. Our single-cell-based signatures provide clues to the relation between EMT and clinical outcomes of breast cancer. In addition, the proposed method can also be useful when applied to scRNA-seq datasets of different biological processes other than EMT. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Cellular aging is a multifactorial process that is characterized by a decline in homeostatic capacity, best described at the molecular level. Physicochemical properties such as pH and macromolecular crowding are essential to all molecular processes in cells and require maintenance. Whether a drift in physicochemical properties contributes to the overall decline of homeostasis in aging is not known. Here, we show that the cytosol of yeast cells acidifies modestly in early aging and sharply after senescence. Using a macromolecular crowding sensor optimized for long-term FRET measurements, we show that crowding is rather stable and that the stability of crowding is a stronger predictor for lifespan than the absolute crowding levels. Additionally, in aged cells, we observe drastic changes in organellar volume, leading to crowding on the micrometer scale, which we term organellar crowding. Our measurements provide an initial framework of physicochemical parameters of replicatively aged yeast cells.},

	abstract = {One goal of aging research is to find drugs that delay the onset of age-associated disease. Studies in invertebrates, particularly Caenorhabditis elegans, have uncovered numerous genes involved in aging, many conserved in mammals. However, which of these encode proteins suitable for drug targeting is unknown. To investigate this question, we screened a library of compounds with known mammalian pharmacology for compounds that increase C. elegans lifespan. We identified 60 compounds that increase longevity in C. elegans, 33 of which also increased resistance to oxidative stress. Many of these compounds are drugs approved for human use. Enhanced resistance to oxidative stress was associated primarily with compounds that target receptors for biogenic amines, such as dopamine or serotonin. A pharmacological network constructed with these data reveal that lifespan extension and increased stress resistance cluster together in a few pharmacological classes, most involved in intercellular signaling. These studies identify compounds that can now be explored for beneficial effects on aging in mammals, as well as tools that can be used to further investigate the mechanisms underlying aging in C. elegans.},

	abstract = {The Lightning Network is a so-called second-layer technology built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to provide “off-chain” fast payment channels between users, which means that not all transactions are settled and stored on the main blockchain. In this paper, we model the emergence of the Lightning Network as a (bond) percolation process and we explore how the distributional properties of the volume and size of transactions per user may impact its feasibility. The agents are all able to reciprocally transfer Bitcoins using the main blockchain and also – if economically convenient – to open a channel on the Lightning Network and transact “off chain”. We base our approach on fitness-dependent network models: as in real life, a Lightning channel is opened with a probability that depends on the “fitness” of the concurring nodes, which in turn depends on wealth and volume of transactions. The emergence of a connected component is studied numerically and analytically as a function of the parameters, and the phase transition separating regions in the phase space where the Lightning Network is sustainable or not is elucidated. We characterize the phase diagram determining the minimal volume of transactions that would make the Lightning Network sustainable for a given level of fees or, alternatively, the maximal cost the Lightning ecosystem may impose for a given average volume of transactions. The model includes parameters that could be in principle estimated from publicly available data once the evolution of the Lighting Network will have reached a stationary operable state, and is fairly robust against different choices of the distributions of parameters and fitness kernels.},

An outstanding question is to what extent this heterogeneity is similar between cancers affecting different organs. Here, we profile 233,591 single cells from patients with lung, colorectal, ovary and breast cancer (n = 36) and construct a pan-cancer blueprint of stromal cell heterogeneity using different single-cell RNA and protein-based technologies. We identify 68 stromal cell populations, of which 46 are shared between cancer types and 22 are unique. We also characterise each population phenotypically by highlighting its marker genes, transcription factors, metabolic activities and tissue-specific expression differences. Resident cell types are characterised by substantial tissue specificity, while tumor-infiltrating cell types are largely shared across cancer types. Finally, by applying the blueprint to melanoma tumors treated with checkpoint immunotherapy and identifying a naïve CD4+ T-cell phenotype predictive of response to checkpoint immunotherapy, we illustrate how it can serve as a guide to interpret scRNA-seq data. In conclusion, by providing a comprehensive blueprint through an interactive web server, we generate the first panoramic view on the shared complexity of stromal cells in different cancers.},

Here, we report results of a late-life DR switch experiment employing 800 mice, in which 24 months old female mice were switched from ad libitum (AL) to DR or vice versa. Strikingly, the switch from DR-to-AL acutely increases mortality, whereas the switch from AL-to-DR causes only a weak and gradual increase in survival, suggesting a memory of earlier nutrition. RNA-seq profiling in liver, brown (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) demonstrate a largely refractory transcriptional and metabolic response to DR after AL feeding in fat tissue, particularly in WAT, and a proinflammatory signature in aged preadipocytes, which is prevented by chronic DR feeding.

	abstract = {Background Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been crucial in providing an understanding of how genetic variants influence gene expression. However, eQTLs are known to exert cell type specific effects, and existing methods to identify cell type specific QTLs in bulk data require large sample sizes. Results Here, we propose DeCAF (DEconvoluted cell type Allele specific Function), a new method to identify cell-fraction (cf) QTLs in tumors by leveraging both allelic and total expression information. Applying DeCAF to RNA-seq data from TCGA, we identified 3,664 genes with cfQTLs (at 10\% FDR) in 14 cell types, a 5.63x increase in discovery over conventional interaction-eQTL mapping. cfQTLs replicated in external cell type specific eQTL data and were more enriched for cancer risk than conventional eQTLs. The intersection of tumorspecific QTL effects (tsQTLs) with GWAS loci identified rs4765621 and SCARB1 , which has been previously linked to renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progression and experimentally validated in tumors. Conclusions Our new method, DeCAF, empowers the discovery of biologically meaningful cfQTLs from bulk RNA-seq data in moderately sized studies. Our study contributes to a better understanding of germline mechanisms underlying the anticancer immune response as well as cfQTLs contributing to cancer risk. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {An enduring challenge in personalized medicine lies in selecting a suitable drug for each individual patient. Here we concentrate on predicting drug responses based on a cohort of genomic, chemical structure, and target information. Therefore, a recently study such as GDSC has provided an unprecedented opportunity to infer the potential relationships between cell line and drug. While existing approach rely primarily on regression, classification or multiple kernel learning to predict drug responses. Synthetic approach indicates drug target and protein-protein interaction could have the potential to improve the prediction performance of drug response. In this study, we propose a novel heterogeneous network-based method, named as HNMDRP, to accurately predict cell line-drug associations through incorporating heterogeneity relationship among cell line, drug and target. Compared to previous study, HNMDRP can make good use of above heterogeneous information to predict drug responses. The validity of our method is verified not only by plotting the ROC curve, but also by predicting novel cell line-drug sensitive associations which have dependable literature evidences. This allows us possibly to suggest potential sensitive associations among cell lines and drugs. Matlab and R codes of HNMDRP can be found at following https://github.com/USTC-HIlab/HNMDRP .},

As a consequence, there has been growing interest in developing methods to integrate such data to obtain deeper insights regarding the underlying biological system. A key challenge for integrative studies is the heterogeneity present in the different omics data sources, which makes it difficult to discern the coordinated signal of interest from source-specific noise or extraneous effects. RESULTS: We introduce a novel method of multi-modal data analysis that is designed for heterogeneous data based on non-negative matrix factorization. We provide an algorithm for jointly decomposing the data matrices involved that also includes a sparsity option for high-dimensional settings. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on synthetic data and on real DNA methylation, gene expression and miRNA expression data from ovarian cancer samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The results show the presence of common modules across patient samples linked to cancer-related pathways, as well as previously established ovarian cancer subtypes.

	abstract = {In response to the health crisis presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid development of safe and effective vaccines that elicit durable immune responses is imperative. Recent reports have raised the concern that antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent patients may not be long lasting and thus even these individuals may require vaccination. Vaccine candidates currently in clinical testing have focused on the SARS-CoV-2 wild type spike (S) protein (S-WT) as the major antigen of choice and while pre-clinical and early clinical testing have shown that S elicits an antibody response, we believe the optimal vaccine candidate should be capable of inducing robust, durable T-cell responses as well as humoral responses. We report here on a next generation bivalent human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) vaccine capable of inducing immunity in patients with pre-existing adenovirus immunity, comprising both an S sequence optimized for cell surface expression (S-Fusion) and a conserved nucleocapsid (N) antigen designed to be transported to the endosomal subcellular compartment, with the potential to generate durable immune protection. Our studies suggest that this bivalent vaccine is optimized for immunogenicity as evidenced by the following findings: (i) The optimized S-Fusion displayed improved S receptor binding domain (RBD) cell surface expression compared to S-WT where little surface expression was detected; (ii) the expressed RBD from S-Fusion retained conformational integrity and recognition by ACE2-Fc; (iii) the viral N protein modified with an enhanced T-cell stimulation domain (ETSD) localized to endosomal/lysosomal subcellular compartments for MHC I/II presentation; and (iv) these optimizations to S and N (S-Fusion and N-ETSD) generated enhanced de novo antigen-specific B cell and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in antigen-naive pre-clinical models. Both the T-cell and antibody immune responses to S and N demonstrated a T-helper 1 (Th1) bias. The antibody responses were neutralizing as demonstrated by two independent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays. Based on these findings, we are advancing this next generation bivalent hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine as our lead clinical candidate to test for its ability to provide robust, durable cell-mediated and humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are ongoing to explore utilizing this vaccine construct in oral, intranasal, and sublingual formulations to induce mucosal immunity in addition to cell-mediated and humoral immunity. The ultimate goal of an ideal COVID-19 vaccine is to generate long-term T and B cell memory. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement Authors (1) \& (7) are employed and/or hold interests in either ImmunityBio, Inc. or NantKwest, Inc.},

	abstract = {Although cellular senescence is increasingly recognized as driving multiple age-related co-morbidities through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), in vivo senescent cell identification, particularly in bulk or single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data remains challenging. Here, we generated a novel gene set (SenMayo) and first validated its enrichment in bone biopsies from two aged human cohorts. SenMayo also identified senescent cells in aged murine brain tissue, demonstrating applicability across tissues and species. For direct validation, we demonstrated significant reductions in SenMayo in bone following genetic clearance of senescent cells in mice, with similar findings in adipose tissue from humans in a pilot study of pharmacological senescent cell clearance. In direct comparisons, SenMayo outperformed all six existing senescence/SASP gene sets in identifying senescent cells across tissues and in demonstrating responses to senescent cell clearance. We next used SenMayo to identify senescent hematopoietic or mesenchymal cells at the single cell level from publicly available human and murine bone marrow/bone scRNA-seq data and identified monocytic and osteolineage cells, respectively, as showing the highest levels of senescence/SASP genes. Using pseudotime and cellular communication patterns, we found senescent hematopoietic and mesenchymal cells communicated with other cells through common pathways, including the Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) pathway, which has been implicated not only in inflammation but also in immune evasion, an important property of senescent cells. Thus, SenMayo identifies senescent cells across tissues and species with high fidelity. Moreover, using this senescence panel, we were able to characterize senescent cells at the single cell level and identify key intercellular signaling pathways associated with these cells, which may be particularly useful for evolving efforts to map senescent cells ( e.g ., SenNet). In addition, SenMayo represents a potentially clinically applicable panel for monitoring senescent cell burden with aging and other conditions as well as in studies of senolytic drugs. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement Patents on senolytic drugs and their uses and on SASP biomarkers are held by Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota.

Critically, {\textgreater}50\% of the somatic alterations identified in individual samples were in proteins affecting Master-Regulator activity, thus yielding novel insight into mechanisms linking tumor genetics and transcriptional identity and establishing novel non-oncogene dependencies.

ACTIONet provides a robust, reproducible, and highly interpretable single-cell analysis platform that couples dominant pattern discovery with a corresponding structural representation of the cell state landscape. Using multiple synthetic and real data sets, we demonstrate ACTIONet's superior performance relative to existing alternatives. We use ACTIONet to integrate and annotate cells across three human cortex data sets.

APC may assume 0, 1 or 2 truncating mutations, each with a striking differential impact on survival. Tumours lacking any APC mutation carry a worse prognosis than single APC mutation tumours; however, two APC mutation tumours with mutant KRAS and TP53 confer the poorest survival among all the subgroups examined.

	abstract = {Precision medicine might be the response to the recent questioning of the use of metformin as an anticancer drug in colorectal cancer (CRC). Thus, in order to establish properly its benefits, metformin application needs to be assayed on the different progression stages of CRC. In this way, intestinal organoids imply a more physiological tool, representing a new therapeutic opportunity for CRC personalized treatment to assay tumor stage-dependent drugs. The previously reported lipid metabolism-related axis, Acyl-CoA synthetases/ Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (ACSLs/SCD), stimulates colon cancer progression and metformin is able to rescue the invasive and migratory phenotype conferred to cancer cells upon this axis overexpression. Therefore, we checked ACSL/SCD axis status, its regulatory miRNAs and the effect of metformin treatment in intestinal organoids with the most common acquired mutations in a sporadic CRC (CRC-like organoids) as a model for specific and personalized treatment. Despite ACSL4 expression is upregulated progressively in CRC-like organoids, metformin is able to downregulate its expression, especially in the first two stages (I, II). Besides, organoids are clearly more sensitive in the first stage (Apc mutated) to metformin than current chemotherapeutic drugs such as fluorouracil (5-FU). Metformin performs an independent “Warburg effect” blockade to cancer progression and is able to reduce crypt stem cell markers expression such as LGR5+. These results suggest a putative increased efficiency of the use of metformin in early stages of CRC than in advanced disease.},

	abstract = {The field of synthetic biology promises to revolutionize biotechnology through the design of organisms with novel phenotypes useful for medicine, agriculture and industry. However, a limiting factor is the ability of current methods to assemble complex DNA molecules encoding multiple genetic elements in various predefined arrangements. We present here a hierarchical modular cloning system that allows the creation at will and with high efficiency of any eukaryotic multigene construct, starting from libraries of defined and validated basic modules containing regulatory and coding sequences. This system is based on the ability of type IIS restriction enzymes to assemble multiple DNA fragments in a defined linear order. We constructed a 33 kb DNA molecule containing 11 transcription units made from 44 individual basic modules in only three successive cloning steps. This modular cloning (MoClo) system can be readily automated and will be extremely useful for applications such as gene stacking and metabolic engineering.},

	abstract = {Screening drugs on patient biopsies from solid tumours has immense potential, but is challenging due to the small amount of available material. To address this, we present here a plug-based microfluidics platform for functional screening of drug combinations. Integrated Braille valves allow changing the plug composition on demand and enable collecting {\textgreater}1200 data points (56 different conditions with at least 20 replicates each) per biopsy. After deriving and validating efficient and specific drug combinations for two genetically different pancreatic cancer cell lines and xenograft mouse models, we additionally screen live cells from human solid tumours with no need for ex vivo culturing steps, and obtain highly specific sensitivity profiles. The entire workflow can be completed within 48 h at assay costs of less than US\$ 150 per patient. We believe this can pave the way for rapid determination of optimal personalized cancer therapies. Cancer patients exhibit specific sensitivities toward drug combinations that cannot be easily predicted. Here the authors setup a microfluidic platform that allows testing of multiple drug combinations correctly predicting sensitivity in vivo and they use it on patients biopsies to define effective drugs.},

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can generate the three germ layers in culture; however, differentiation is typically heterogeneous and spatially disordered. We show that geometric confinement is sufficient to trigger self-organized patterning in hESCs. In response to BMP4, colonies reproducibly differentiated to an outer trophectoderm-like ring, an inner ectodermal circle and a ring of mesendoderm expressing primitive-streak markers in between. Fates were defined relative to the boundary with a fixed length scale: small colonies corresponded to the outer layers of larger ones. Inhibitory signals limited the range of BMP4 signaling to the colony edge and induced a gradient of Activin-Nodal signaling that patterned mesendodermal fates. These results demonstrate that the intrinsic tendency of stem cells to make patterns can be harnessed by controlling colony geometries and provide a quantitative assay for studying paracrine signaling in early development.},

This method significantly reduced the temperature variation around target temperature. Importantly, this method demonstrated a parallel and consistent relationship between rectal temperature and brain temperature (the brain temperature was consistently 0.5C higher than rectal temperature) throughout hypothermia maintenance. This technique may be well adapted to hypothermia studies in mice and other rodents, especially to the assessment and regulation of brain temperature during studies.},

We apply FLEX to analyze data from the diverse cell line screens generated by the DepMap project. We identify a predominant mitochondria-associated signal within co-essentiality networks derived from these data and explore the basis of this signal. Our analysis and time-resolved CRISPR screens in a single cell line suggest that the variable phenotypes associated with mitochondria genes across cells may reflect screen dynamics and protein stability effects rather than genetic dependencies. We characterize this functional bias and demonstrate its relevance for interpreting differential hits in any CRISPR screening context.

Therefore, we use a well-standardized metabolomics platform to identify metabolic predictors of long-term mortality in the circulation of 44,168 individuals (age at baseline 18-109), of whom 5512 died during follow-up. We apply a stepwise (forward-backward) procedure based on meta-analysis results and identify 14 circulating biomarkers independently associating with all-cause mortality. Overall, these associations are similar in men and women and across different age strata. We subsequently show that the prediction accuracy of 5- and 10-year mortality based on a model containing the identified biomarkers and sex (C-statistic = 0.837 and 0.830, respectively) is better than that of a model containing conventional risk factors for mortality (C-statistic = 0.772 and 0.790, respectively).

	url = {https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryxWIgBFPS},
	abstract = {We propose to use a meta-learning objective that maximizes the speed of transfer on a modified distribution to learn how to modularize acquired knowledge. In particular, we focus on how to factor a joint distribution into appropriate conditionals, consistent with the causal directions. We explain when this can work, using the assumption that the changes in distributions are localized (e.g. to one of the marginals, for example due to an intervention on one of the variables). We prove that under this assumption of localized changes in causal mechanisms, the correct causal graph will tend to have only a few of its parameters with non-zero gradient, i.e. that need to be adapted (those of the modified variables). We argue and observe experimentally that this leads to faster adaptation, and use this property to define a meta-learning surrogate score which, in addition to a continuous parametrization of graphs, would favour correct causal graphs. Finally, motivated by the AI agent point of view (e.g. of a robot discovering its environment autonomously), we consider how the same objective can discover the causal variables themselves, as a transformation of observed low-level variables with no causal meaning. Experiments in the two-variable case validate the proposed ideas and theoretical results.},

Consistent with previous reports, rs429358 (apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ϵ4) is associated with lower odds of surviving to the 90th and 99th percentile age, while rs7412 (ApoE ϵ2) shows the opposite. Moreover, rs7676745, located near GPR78, associates with lower odds of surviving to the 90th percentile age. Gene-level association analysis reveals a role for tissue-specific expression of multiple genes in longevity. Finally, genetic correlation of the longevity GWA results with that of several disease-related phenotypes points to a shared genetic architecture between health and longevity.},

In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised method to learn SMILES and chemical contexts of molecules simultaneously in pre-training the Transformer. The key of our model is learning structures with adjacency matrix embedding and learning logics that can infer descriptors via Quantitative Estimation of Drug-likeness prediction in pre-training. As a result, our method improves the generalization of the data and achieves the best average performance by benchmarking downstream tasks.

Recent studies have demonstrated the role of non-genetic (i.e. phenotypic) adaptations in tolerating drug treatments; however, the mechanisms and dynamics of such non-genetic adaptation remain elusive. Here, we investigate coupled dynamics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer cells and emergence of reversible drug resistance. Our mechanism-based model for underlying regulatory network reveals that these two axes can drive one another, thus enabling non-genetic heterogeneity in a cell population by allowing for six co-existing phenotypes: epithelial-sensitive, mesenchymal-resistant, hybrid E/M-sensitive, hybrid E/M-resistant, mesenchymal-sensitive and epithelial-resistant, with the first two ones being most dominant. Next, in a population dynamics framework, we exemplify the implications of phenotypic plasticity (both drug-induced and intrinsic stochastic switching) and/or non-genetic heterogeneity in promoting population survival in a mixture of sensitive and resistant cells, even in the absence of any cell-cell cooperation. Finally, we propose the potential therapeutic use of mesenchymal-epithelial transition inducers besides canonical anti-estrogen therapy to limit the emergence of reversible drug resistance. Our results offer mechanistic insights into empirical observations on EMT and drug resistance and illustrate how such dynamical insights can be exploited for better therapeutic designs.},

	abstract = {Understanding the genetic and epigenetic bases of cellular senescence is instrumental in developing interventions to slow aging. We performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9–based screens using two types of human mesenchymal precursor cells (hMPCs) exhibiting accelerated senescence. The hMPCs were derived from human embryonic stem cells carrying the pathogenic mutations that cause the accelerated aging diseases Werner syndrome and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Genes whose deficiency alleviated cellular senescence were identified, including KAT7 , a histone acetyltransferase, which ranked as a top hit in both progeroid hMPC models. Inactivation of KAT7 decreased histone H3 lysine 14 acetylation, repressed p15 INK4b transcription, and alleviated hMPC senescence. Moreover, lentiviral vectors encoding Cas9/sg- Kat7 , given intravenously, alleviated hepatocyte senescence and liver aging and extended life span in physiologically aged mice as well as progeroid Zmpste24 −/− mice that exhibit a premature aging phenotype. CRISPR-Cas9–based genetic screening is a robust method for systematically uncovering senescence genes such as KAT7 , which may represent a therapeutic target for developing aging interventions.},

	abstract = {Objective To analyze the impact of factors in healthcare delivery on the net benefit of triggering an Advanced Care Planning (ACP) workflow based on predictions of 12-month mortality. Materials and Methods We built a predictive model of 12-month mortality using electronic health record data and evaluated the impact of healthcare delivery factors on the net benefit of triggering an ACP workflow based on the models' predictions. Factors included non-clinical reasons that make ACP inappropriate, limited capacity for ACP, inability to follow up due to patient discharge, and availability of an outpatient workflow to follow up on missed cases. We also quantified the relative benefits of increasing capacity for inpatient ACP versus outpatient ACP. Results Work capacity constraints and discharge timing can significantly reduce the net benefit of triggering the ACP workflow based on a model's predictions. However, the reduction can be mitigated by creating an outpatient ACP workflow. Given limited resources to either add capacity for inpatient ACP versus developing outpatient ACP capability, the latter is likely to provide more benefit to patient care. Discussion The benefit of using a predictive model for identifying patients for interventions is highly dependent on the capacity to execute the workflow triggered by the model. We provide a framework for quantifying the impact of healthcare delivery factors and work capacity constraints on achieved benefit. Conclusion An analysis of the sensitivity of the net benefit realized by a predictive model triggered clinical workflow to various healthcare delivery factors is necessary for making predictive models useful in practice.},

The spatial organization of the processing units on DNA origami enables facile modulation of the energy landscape of DNA strand displacement reactions, allowing precise control of the reactions along predefined paths for different input orders. The use of spatial constraints brings about a simple, modular design for the FSM with a minimum set of orthogonal components and confers minimized leaky reactions and fast kinetics. The FSM demonstrates the capability of sensing the temporal orders of two microRNAs, highlighting its potential for temporally resolved biosensing and smart therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Millions of Americans are affected by rare diseases, many of which have poor survival rates. However, the small market size of individual rare diseases, combined with the time and capital requirements of pharmaceutical R\&D, have hindered the development of new drugs for these cases. A promising alternative is drug repurposing, whereby existing FDA-approved drugs might be used to treat diseases different from their original indications. In order to generate drug repurposing hypotheses in a systematic and comprehensive fashion, it is essential to integrate information from across the literature of pharmacology, genetics, and pathology. To this end, we leverage a newly developed knowledge graph, the Global Network of Biomedical Relationships (GNBR). GNBR is a large, heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising drug, disease, and gene (or protein) entities linked by a small set of semantic themes derived from the abstracts of biomedical literature. We apply a knowledge graph embedding method that explicitly models the uncertainty associated with literature-derived relationships and uses link prediction to generate drug repurposing hypotheses. This approach achieves high performance on a gold-standard test set of known drug indications (AUROC = 0.89) and is capable of generating novel repurposing hypotheses, which we independently validate using external literature sources and protein interaction networks. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our model to produce explanations of its predictions.},

The clustering of these primary cells reveals that most cells in the human body share a few broad transcriptional programs, which define five major cell types: epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, neural, and blood cells. These act as basic components of many tissues and organs. Based on gene expression, these cell types redefine the basic histological types by which tissues have been traditionally classified. We identified genes whose expression is specific to these cell types, and from these genes, we estimated the contribution of the major cell types to the composition of human tissues. We found this cellular composition to be a characteristic signature of tissues and to reflect tissue morphological heterogeneity and histology. We identified changes in cellular composition in different tissues associated with age and sex, and found that departures from the normal cellular composition correlate with histological phenotypes associated with disease.},

However, a global and detailed characterization of the changes that human circulating immune cells undergo with age is lacking. Here, we combined scRNA-seq, mass cytometry and scATAC-seq to compare immune cell types in peripheral blood collected from young and old subjects and patients with COVID-19. We found that the immune cell landscape was reprogrammed with age and was characterized by T cell polarization from naive and memory cells to effector, cytotoxic, exhausted and regulatory cells, along with increased late natural killer cells, age-associated B cells, inflammatory monocytes and age-associated dendritic cells. In addition, the expression of genes, which were implicated in coronavirus susceptibility, was upregulated in a cell subtype-specific manner with age. Notably, COVID-19 promoted age-induced immune cell polarization and gene expression related to inflammation and cellular senescence. Therefore, these findings suggest that a dysregulated immune system and increased gene expression associated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility may at least partially account for COVID-19 vulnerability in the elderly.},

	abstract = {Understanding the trajectory of a developing human requires an understanding of how genes are regulated and expressed. Two papers now present a pooled approach using three levels of combinatorial indexing to examine the single-cell gene expression and chromatin landscapes from 15 organs in fetal samples. Cao et al. focus on measurements of RNA in broadly distributed cell types and provide insights into organ specificity. Domcke et al. examined the chromatin accessibility of cells from these organs and identify the regulatory elements that regulate gene expression. Together, these analyses generate comprehensive atlases of early human development. Science , this issue p. [eaba7721][1], p. [eaba7612][2] \#\#\# INTRODUCTION In recent years, the single-cell genomics field has made incredible progress toward disentangling the cellular heterogeneity of human tissues. However, the overwhelming majority of effort has been focused on single-cell gene expression rather than the chromatin landscape that shapes and is shaped by gene expression. Toward advancing our understanding of the regulatory programs that underlie human cell types, we set out to generate single-cell atlases of both chromatin accessibility (this study) and gene expression (Cao et al. , this issue) from a broad range of human fetal tissues. \#\#\# RATIONALE Regions of accessible chromatin in our genome, such as enhancers, play key roles in the determination and maintenance of cell fates. Accessible regions are also markedly enriched for genetic variation that contributes to common disease heritability. The vast majority of chromatin accessibility data collected to date lacks single-cell resolution, limiting our ability to infer patterns such as which cell types are most relevant to each common disease. We previously demonstrated single-cell profiling of chromatin accessibility using combinatorial indexing, based on two rounds of in situ molecular barcoding. Here, we describe an improved assay that uses three levels of combinatorial indexing and does not rely on custom reagents. The method, sci-ATAC-seq3, reduces costs and opens the door to the scales necessary for generating a human cell atlas of chromatin accessibility. \#\#\# RESULTS We applied sci-ATAC-seq3 to 59 human fetal samples ranging from 89 to 125 days in estimated postconceptual age and representing 15 organs, altogether obtaining high-quality chromatin accessibility profiles from  800,000 single cells. Gene expression data collected on an overlapping set of tissues were leveraged to annotate cell types. We asked which transcription factor (TF) motifs found in the accessible sites of each cell best explain its cell type affiliation, revealing both known and potentially previously unknown regulators of cell fate specification and/or maintenance. Many TFs could be putatively assigned as activators or repressors depending on whether their expression and the accessibility of their cognate motif were positively or negatively correlated across cell types. Comparing chromatin accessibility from cell types that appear in multiple tissues revealed that whereas blood cell types are highly similar across organs, endothelial cells exhibit organ-specific chromatin accessibility, which appears to be controlled combinatorially by several TFs with overlapping expression patterns. We leveraged our master set of 1.05 million accessible sites, spanning 532 Mb or 17\% of the reference human genome, to score cell type–specific links between candidate enhancers and genes based on coaccessibility, to detect cell type–specific enrichment of heritability for specific common human diseases, and to identify genetic variants affecting chromatin accessibility in cis. Comparisons with chromatin accessibility in corresponding adult tissues allowed us to identify fetal-specific cell subtypes and nominate POU2F1 as a potential regulator of excitatory neuron development. \#\#\# CONCLUSION Sci-ATAC-seq3 adds to a growing repertoire of single-cell methods that use combinatorial indexing, a technical paradigm whose advantages include exponential scaling and greater range to profile diverse aspects of single-cell biology. We anticipate that the intersection of single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression will critically accelerate the field's long-term goal of establishing a deep, predictive understanding of gene regulation. An interactive website facilitates the exploration of these freely available data by tissue, cell type, locus, or motif ([descartes.brotmanbaty.org][3]). ![Figure][4] A human cell atlas of fetal chromatin accessibility enables the exploration of in vivo gene regulation across diverse cell types. We devised a three-level combinatorial indexing assay (sci-ATAC-seq3) and profiled chromatin accessibility in  800,000 single cells from 15 fetal organs. This rich resource enables, for example, identification of cell type–specific regulatory elements and TFs, classification of TFs into activators and repressors, and quantification of cell type–specific enrichments of complex trait heritability, as well as chromatin accessibility dynamics. The chromatin landscape underlying the specification of human cell types is of fundamental interest. We generated human cell atlases of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in fetal tissues. For chromatin accessibility, we devised a three-level combinatorial indexing assay and applied it to 53 samples representing 15 organs, profiling  800,000 single cells. We leveraged cell types defined by gene expression to annotate these data and cataloged hundreds of thousands of candidate regulatory elements that exhibit cell type–specific chromatin accessibility. We investigated the properties of lineage-specific transcription factors (such as POU2F1 in neurons), organ-specific specializations of broadly distributed cell types (such as blood and endothelial), and cell type–specific enrichments of complex trait heritability. These data represent a rich resource for the exploration of in vivo human gene regulation in diverse tissues and cell types.

DNTR-seq readily identified minor subclones within leukemia patients. In a large-scale DNA damage screen, DNTR-seq was used to detect regions under purifying selection and identified genes where mRNA abundance was resistant to copy-number alteration, suggesting strong genetic compensation. mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) quality equals RNA-only methods, and the low positional bias of genomic libraries allowed detection of sub-megabase aberrations at ultra-low coverage. Each cell library is individually addressable and can be re-sequenced at increased depth, allowing multi-tiered study designs. Additionally, the direct tagmentation protocol enables coverage-independent estimation of ploidy, which can be used to identify cell singlets.

	abstract = {The molecular pathogenesis of chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer (NK) cells (CLPD-NK) is poorly understood. Following the screening of 57 CLPD-NK patients, only five presented STAT3 mutations. WES profiling of 13 cases negative for STAT3/STAT5B mutations uncovered an average of 18 clonal, population rare and deleterious somatic variants per patient. The mutational landscape of CLPD-NK showed that most patients carry a heavy mutational burden, with major and subclonal deleterious mutations co-existing in the leukemic clone. Somatic mutations hit genes wired to cancer proliferation, survival, and migration pathways, in the first place Ras/MAPK, PI3K-AKT, in addition to JAK/STAT (PIK3R1 and PTK2). We confirmed variants with putative driver role of MAP10, MPZL1, RPS6KA1, SETD1B, TAOK2, TMEM127, and TNFRSF1A genes, and of genes linked to viral infections (DDX3X and RSF1) and DNA repair (PAXIP1). A truncating mutation of the epigenetic regulator TET2 and a variant likely abrogating PIK3R1-negative regulatory activity were validated. This study significantly furthered the view of the genes and pathways involved in CLPD-NK, indicated similarities with aggressive diseases of NK cells and detected mutated genes targetable by approved drugs, being a step forward to personalized precision medicine for CLPD-NK patients.},

	abstract = {We screened a library of bioactive small molecules for activators and inhibitors of innate immune signaling through IRF3 and NFkB pathways with the goals of advancing pathway understanding and discovering probes for immunology research. We used high content screening to measure the translocation from the cytoplasm to nucleus of IRF3 and NFkB in primary human macrophages; these transcription factors play a critical role in the activation of STING and other pro-inflammatory pathways. Our pathway activator screen yielded a diverse set of hits that promoted nuclear translocation of IRF3 and/or NFkB, but the majority of these compounds did not cause activation of downstream pathways. Screening for antagonists of the STING pathway yielded multiple kinase inhibitors, some of which inhibit kinases not previously known to regulate the activity of this pathway. Structure-activity relationships (SARs) and subsequent chemical proteomics experiments suggested that MAPKAPK5 (PRAK) is a kinase that regulates IRF3 translocation in human macrophages. Our work establishes a high content screening approach for measuring pro-inflammatory pathways in human macrophages and identifies novel ways to inhibit such pathways; among the targets of the screen are several molecules that may merit further development as anti-inflammatory drugs.},

To study the relationship between youthful vigor and lifespan, we developed a new version of “the lifespan machine” that can simultaneously measure age-associated changes in behavior and lifespan at high precision in large populations. Across diverse interventions, we find that behavioral aging and lifespan are not parsimoniously explained as manifestations of a single underlying aging process. Instead, the correlation between youthful vigor and lifespan is better explained as the result of two partially independent aging processes that progress during adulthood under the influence of a shared, systemic factor. Our model provides a framework for separating the direct, targeted effects of lifespan-altering interventions from their broad, systemic effects—supporting future efforts in the rational design of clinical interventions in aging. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

These interactions offer insights into the mechanisms behind higher order biochemical phenomena, such as drug-drug interactions and variations in drug response across individuals. To assist their curation at scale, we must understand what relationship types are possible and map unstructured natural language descriptions onto these structured classes. We used NCBI's PubTator annotations to identify instances of chemical, gene and disease names in Medline abstracts and applied the Stanford dependency parser to find connecting dependency paths between pairs of entities in single sentences. We combined a published ensemble biclustering algorithm (EBC) with hierarchical clustering to group the dependency paths into semantically-related categories, which we annotated with labels, or 'themes' ('inhibition' and 'activation', for example). We evaluated our theme assignments against six human-curated databases: DrugBank, Reactome, SIDER, the Therapeutic Target Database, OMIM and PharmGKB. Results: Clustering revealed 10 broad themes for chemical-gene relationships, 7 for chemical-disease, 10 for gene-disease and 9 for gene-gene. In most cases, enriched themes corresponded directly to known database relationships. Our final dataset, represented as a network, contained 37 491 thematically-labeled chemical-gene edges, 2 021 192 chemical-disease edges, 136 206 gene-disease edges and 41 418 gene-gene edges, each representing a single-sentence description of an interaction from somewhere in the literature. Availability and implementation: The complete network is available on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/1035500). We have also provided the full set of dependency paths connecting biomedical entities in Medline abstracts, with associated sentences, for future use by the biomedical research community.

	abstract = {An ability to safely harness the powerful regenerative potential of adult stem cells for clinical applications is critically dependent on a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms regulating their activity. Epithelial organoid cultures accurately recapitulate many features of in vivo stem cell-driven epithelial renewal, providing an excellent ex vivo platform for interrogation of key regulatory mechanisms. Here, we employed a genome-scale clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) knockout (KO) screening assay using mouse gastric epithelial organoids to identify modulators of Wnt-driven stem cell-dependent epithelial renewal in the gastric mucosa. In addition to known Wnt pathway regulators, such as Apc, we found that KO of Alk, Bclaf3, or Prkra supports the Wnt independent self-renewal of gastric epithelial cells ex vivo. In adult mice, expression of these factors is predominantly restricted to non-Lgr5-expressing stem cell zones above the gland base, implicating a critical role for these factors in suppressing self-renewal or promoting differentiation of gastric epithelia. Notably, we found that Alk inhibits Wnt signaling by phosphorylating the tyrosine of Gsk3β, while Bclaf3 and Prkra suppress regenerating islet-derived (Reg) genes by regulating the expression of epithelial interleukins. Therefore, Alk, Bclaf3, and Prkra may suppress stemness/proliferation and function as novel regulators of gastric epithelial differentiation.},

Effective, inducible CRISPRi has been demonstrated in budding yeast, and genome-scale guide libraries enable systematic, genome-wide genetic analysis. RESULTS: We present a comprehensive yeast CRISPRi library, based on empirical design rules, containing 10 distinct guides for most genes. Competitive growth after pooled transformation revealed strong fitness defects for most essential genes, verifying that the library provides comprehensive genome coverage. We used the relative growth defects caused by different guides targeting essential genes to further refine yeast CRISPRi design rules. In order to obtain more accurate and robust guide abundance measurements in pooled screens, we link guides with random nucleotide barcodes and carry out linear amplification by in vitro transcription.

The cellular organization of tissues was then poorly understood, with almost nothing known about cancer drivers and stem cells. The MMC paradigm was later confirmed, and cancer incidence was explained as a function of mutation occurrence. However, the MMC has never been tested for its ability to account for the discrepancies in the number of driver mutations and the organization of the stem cell compartments underlying different cancers that still demonstrate nearly universal age-dependent incidence patterns. Here we demonstrate by Monte Carlo modeling the impact of key somatic evolutionary parameters on the MMC performance, revealing that two additional major mechanisms, aging-dependent somatic selection and life history-dependent evolution of species-specific tumor suppressor mechanisms, need to be incorporated into the MMC to make it capable of generalizing cancer incidence across tissues and species.

	abstract = {The goal of big projects like Human Cell Atlas (HCA) and Human BioMedical Atlas Program (HuBMAP) is to build maps that comprehensively define and describe all cell types and their molecular features in a healthy human being. Just like geographical maps must have coordinates, a key task in building cell maps is to provide coordinate systems for cells. A well-designed coordinate system helps better understand the highly orchestrated function and organization of different cells. Cells could be depicted by external information like their spatial locations in the body and organ, the sex and race of the donor, and multiple endogenous attributes of cells such as their types, states, functions, developing trajectory, etc. These heterogeneities are encoded in or can be predicted with transcriptomics and other omics data. Cell heterogeneities are multifaceted, including three major types: continuous values or scores, categorical groups and structured annotations. Here we propose to a unified multidimensional coordinate system UniCoord to represent the multifaceted heterogeneities of cells. It is based on a general deep learning framework, with a supervised VAE structure to learn the mapping relationship between gene expressions and the generated coordinates in a low-dimensional space that encode multiple cell attributes of the three types. Experiment results on several datasets showed that UniCoord was able to represent a variety of cell heterogeneous properties that are discrete, continuous or of hierarchical structures. The trained UniCoord model can be used to automatically label attributes of cells and generate the corresponding expression data. Experiments showed that UniCoord is a feasible coordinates framework for representing multifaceted cell heterogeneity in comprehensive cell atlases. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, current protocols yield either complex but highly heterogeneous aggregates (`organoids') or 3D structures with less physiological relevance (`spheroids'). Here, we present a scalable, HTS-compatible workflow for the automated generation, maintenance, and optical analysis of human midbrain organoids in standard 96-well-plates. The resulting organoids possess a highly homogeneous morphology, size, global gene expression, cellular composition, and structure. They present significant features of the human midbrain and display spontaneous aggregate-wide synchronized neural activity. By automating the entire workflow from generation to analysis, we enhance the intra- and inter-batch reproducibility as demonstrated via RNA sequencing and quantitative whole mount high-content imaging. This allows assessing drug effects at the single-cell level within a complex 3D cell environment in a fully automated HTS workflow.},

	abstract = {The more than 500 single-cell transcriptomics studies that have been published to date constitute a valuable and vast resource for biological discovery. While various “atlas” projects have collated some of the associated datasets, most questions related to specific tissue types, species, or other attributes of studies require identifying papers through manual and challenging literature search. To facilitate discovery with published single-cell transcriptomics data, we have assembled a near exhaustive, manually curated database of single-cell transcriptomics studies with key information: descriptions of the type of data and technologies used, along with descriptors of the biological systems studied. Additionally, the database contains summarized information about analysis in the papers, allowing for analysis of trends in the field. As an example, we show that the number of cell types identified in scRNA-seq studies is proportional to the number of cells analysed. The database is available at [www.nxn.se/single-cell-studies/gui][1]. [1]: https://www.nxn.se/single-cell-studies/gui},

	abstract = {We propose a design for philanthropic or publicly-funded seeding to allow (near) optimal provision of a decentralized, self-organizing ecosystem of public goods. The concept extends ideas from Quadratic Voting to a funding mechanism for endogenous community formation. Individuals make public goods contributions to projects of value to them. The amount received by the project is (proportional to) the square of the sum of the square roots of contributions received. Under the “standard model” this yields first best public goods provision. Variations can limit the cost, help protect against collusion and aid coordination. We discuss applications to campaign finance, open source software ecosystems, news media finance and urban public projects. More broadly, we offer a resolution to the classic liberal-communitarian debate in political philosophy by providing neutral and non-authoritarian rules that nonetheless support collective organization.},

Here, we report the genome sequence of a microbial eukaryote, the oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp., which revealed that this organism lacks all hallmark mitochondrial proteins. Crucially, the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly pathway, thought to be conserved in virtually all eukaryotic cells, has been replaced by a cytosolic sulfur mobilization system (SUF) acquired by lateral gene transfer from bacteria. In the context of eukaryotic phylogeny, our data suggest that Monocercomonoides is not primitively amitochondrial but has lost the mitochondrion secondarily. This is the first example of a eukaryote lacking any form of a mitochondrion, demonstrating that this organelle is not absolutely essential for the viability of a eukaryotic cell.},

In this study, we performed transcriptional profiling of bulk CAR T cell populations and single cells to characterize the transcriptional states of human T cells transduced with CD3ζ, 4-1BB-CD3ζ (BBζ), or CD28-CD3ζ (28ζ) co-stimulatory domains at rest and after activation by triggering their CAR or their endogenous T cell receptor (TCR). We identified a transcriptional signature common across CARs with the CD3ζ signaling domain, as well as a distinct program associated with the 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain at rest and after activation. CAR T cells bearing BBζ had increased expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes, ENPP2, and interleukin (IL)-21 axis genes, and decreased PD1 compared to 28ζ CAR T cells. Similar to previous studies, we also found BBζ CAR CD8 T cells to be enriched in a central memory cell phenotype and fatty acid metabolism genes. Our data uncovered transcriptional signatures related to costimulatory domains and demonstrated that signaling domains included in CARs uniquely shape the transcriptional programs of T cells.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are of great help when researchers try to understand the nature of causal relationships and the consequences of conditioning on different variables. One fundamental feature of causal relations that has not been incorporated into the standard DAG framework is interaction, i.e. when the effect of one variable (on a chosen scale) depends on the value that another variable is set to. In this paper, we propose a new type of DAG-the interaction DAG (IDAG), which can be used to understand this phenomenon. METHODS: The IDAG works like any DAG but instead of including a node for the outcome, it includes a node for a causal effect. We introduce concepts such as confounded interaction and total, direct and indirect interaction, showing that these can be depicted in ways analogous to how similar concepts are depicted in standard DAGs. This also allows for conclusions on which treatment interactions to account for empirically. Moreover, since generalizability can be compromised in the presence of underlying interactions, the framework can be used to illustrate threats to generalizability and to identify variables to account for in order to make results valid for the target population. CONCLUSIONS: The IDAG allows for a both intuitive and stringent way of illustrating interactions. It helps to distinguish between causal and non-causal mechanisms behind effect variation. Conclusions about how to empirically estimate interactions can be drawn-as well as conclusions about how to achieve generalizability in contexts where interest lies in estimating an overall effect.},

To facilitate DNN training, we synthesize and characterize in vivo a dataset of 91,534 toehold switches spanning 23 viral genomes and 906 human transcription factors. DNNs trained on nucleotide sequences outperform (R2 = 0.43-0.70) previous state-of-the-art thermodynamic and kinetic models (R2 = 0.04-0.15) and allow for human-understandable attention-visualizations (VIS4Map) to identify success and failure modes.

We find that drugs in R-CHOP exhibit very low cross-resistance but not synergistic interaction: together they achieve a greater fractional kill according to the null hypothesis for both the Loewe dose-additivity model and the Bliss effect-independence model. These data provide direct evidence for the 50 year old hypothesis that a curative cancer therapy can be constructed on the basis of independently effective drugs having non-overlapping mechanisms of resistance, without synergistic interaction, which has immediate significance for the design of new drug combinations.},

However, while transcription factor over-expression-based methods have shown great promise in generating cell types in vitro, they often endure low conversion efficiency. In this context, great effort has been devoted to increasing the efficiency of current protocols and the development of computational approaches can be of great help in this endeavor. Here we introduce a computer-guided design tool that combines a computational framework for prioritizing more efficient combinations of instructive factors (IFs) of cellular conversions, called IRENE, with a transposon-based genomic integration system for efficient delivery. Particularly, IRENE relies on a stochastic gene regulatory network model that systematically prioritizes more efficient IFs by maximizing the agreement of the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes between the converted and target cells. Our predictions substantially increased the efficiency of two established iPSC-differentiation protocols (natural killer cells and melanocytes) and established the first protocol for iPSC-derived mammary epithelial cells with high efficiency.},

By screening the library in three hPSC lines, we discovered 290 TFs, including 241 that were previously unreported, that induce differentiation in 4 days without alteration of external soluble or biomechanical cues. We used four of the hits to program hPSCs into neurons, fibroblasts, oligodendrocytes and vascular endothelial-like cells that have molecular and functional similarity to primary cells. Our cell-autonomous approach enabled parallel programming of hPSCs into multiple cell types simultaneously. We also demonstrated orthogonal programming by including oligodendrocyte-inducible hPSCs with unmodified hPSCs to generate cerebral organoids, which expedited in situ myelination. Large-scale combinatorial screening of the Human TFome will complement other strategies for cell engineering based on developmental biology and computational systems biology.},

Here we undertake native RNA sequencing of polyA + RNA from two human cell lines, analysing  5.2 million aligned native RNA reads. To enable informative comparisons, we also perform relevant ONT direct cDNA- and Illumina-sequencing. We find that while native RNA sequencing does enable some of the anticipated advantages, key unexpected aspects currently hamper its performance, most notably the quite frequent inability to obtain full-length transcripts from single reads, as well as difficulties to unambiguously infer their true transcript of origin. While characterising issues that need to be addressed when investigating more complex transcriptomes, our study highlights that with some defined improvements, native RNA sequencing could be an important addition to the mammalian transcriptomics toolbox.},

	abstract = {A critical step in the analysis of large genome-wide gene expression datasets is the use of module detection methods to group genes into co-expression modules. Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.},

	abstract = {Abstract Cancer genome studies have significantly advanced our knowledge of somatic mutations. However, how these mutations accumulate in normal cells and whether they promote pre-cancerous lesions remains poorly understood. Here we perform a comprehensive analysis of normal tissues by utilizing RNA sequencing data from ∼6,700 samples across 29 normal tissues collected as part of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We identify somatic mutations using a newly developed pipeline, RNA-MuTect, for calling somatic mutations directly from RNA-seq samples and their matched-normal DNA. When applied to the GTEx dataset, we detect multiple variants across different tissues and find that mutation burden is associated with both the age of the individual and tissue proliferation rate. We also detect hotspot cancer mutations that share tissue specificity with their matched cancer type. This study is the first to analyze a large number of samples across multiple normal tissues, identifying clones with genomic aberrations observed in cancer.},

Although the inference of tumor phylogenies is rapidly becoming standard practice in cancer genome analyses, standards for evaluating them are lacking. To address this need, we systematically assess methods for reconstructing tumor subclonality. First, we elucidate the main algorithmic problems in subclonal reconstruction and develop quantitative metrics for evaluating them. Then we simulate realistic tumor genomes that harbor all known clonal and subclonal mutation types and processes. Finally, we benchmark 580 tumor reconstructions, varying tumor read depth, tumor type and somatic variant detection.

Although BSA conversion equations have been used in certain clinical applications for decades, recent recommendations to use BSA to derive interspecies equivalents for therapeutic dosages of drug and natural products are inappropriate. A thorough review of the literature reveals that BSA conversions are based on antiquated science and have little justification in current translational medicine compared to more advanced allometric and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling. Misunderstood and misinterpreted use of BSA conversions may have disastrous consequences, including underdosing leading to abandonment of potentially efficacious investigational drugs, and unexpected deadly adverse events. We aim to demonstrate that recent recommendations for BSA are not appropriate for animal-to-human dosage conversions and use pharmacokinetic data from resveratrol studies to demonstrate how confusion between the "human equivalent dose" and "pharmacologically active dose" can lead to inappropriate dose recommendations. To optimize drug development, future recommendations for interspecies scaling must be scientifically justified using physiologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology data rather than simple BSA conversion.},

Genetic fate-mapping of Alpi(+) cells before or during targeted ablation of Lgr5-expressing stem cells generated numerous long-lived crypt-villus "ribbons," indicative of dedifferentiation of enterocyte precursors into Lgr5(+) stems. By single-cell analysis of dedifferentiating enterocytes, we observed the generation of Paneth-like cells and proliferative stem cells.

There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6\% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4\% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6\%), prostate cancer (7.1\%), and colorectal cancer (6.1\%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2\%), stomach cancer (8.2\%), and liver cancer (8.2\%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

Local methods, conversely, scale to large simulations but have suffered from inferior accuracy. This work introduces Allegro, a strictly local equivariant deep neural network interatomic potential architecture that simultaneously exhibits excellent accuracy and scalability. Allegro represents a many-body potential using iterated tensor products of learned equivariant representations without atom-centered message passing. Allegro obtains improvements over state-of-the-art methods on QM9 and revMD17. A single tensor product layer outperforms existing deep MPNNs and transformers on QM9. Furthermore, Allegro displays remarkable generalization to out-of-distribution data. Molecular simulations using Allegro recover structural and kinetic properties of an amorphous electrolyte in excellent agreement with ab-initio simulations. Finally, we demonstrate parallelization with a simulation of 100 million atoms.},

	abstract = {We have conducted a narrative review based on a structured search strategy, focusing on the effects of metformin on the progression of non-diabetic hyperglycemia to clinical type 2 diabetes mellitus. The principal trials that demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of diabetes in at-risk populations randomized to metformin (mostly with impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) were published mainly from 1999 to 2012. Metformin reduced the 3-year risk of diabetes by -31\% in the randomized phase of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), vs. -58\% for intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI). Metformin was most effective in younger, heavier subjects. Diminishing but still significant reductions in diabetes risk for subjects originally randomized to these groups were present in the trial's epidemiological follow-up, the DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) at 10 years (-18 and -34\%, respectively), 15 years (-18 and -27\%), and 22 years (-18 and -25\%). Long-term weight loss was also seen in both groups, with better maintenance under metformin. Subgroup analyses from the DPP/DPPOS have shed important light on the actions of metformin, including a greater effect in women with prior gestational diabetes, and a reduction in coronary artery calcium in men that might suggest a cardioprotective effect. Improvements in long-term clinical outcomes with metformin in people with non-diabetic hyperglycemia ("prediabetes") have yet to be demonstrated, but cardiovascular and microvascular benefits were seen for those in the DPPOS who did not vs. did develop diabetes. Multiple health economic analyses suggest that either metformin or ILI is cost-effective in a community setting. Long-term diabetes prevention with metformin is feasible and is supported in influential guidelines for selected groups of subjects. Future research will demonstrate whether intervention with metformin in people with non-diabetic hyperglycemia will improve long-term clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Current concepts regarding the biology of aging are primarily based on studies aimed at identifying factors regulating lifespan. However, lifespan as a sole proxy measure for aging can be of limited value because it may be restricted by specific pathologies. Here, we employ large-scale phenotyping to analyze hundreds of markers in aging male C57BL/6J mice. For each phenotype, we establish lifetime profiles to determine when age-dependent change is first detectable relative to the young adult baseline. We examine key lifespan regulators (putative anti-aging interventions; PAAIs) for a possible countering of aging. Importantly, unlike most previous studies, we include in our study design young treated groups of animals, subjected to PAAIs prior to the onset of detectable age-dependent phenotypic change. Many PAAI effects influence phenotypes long before the onset of detectable age-dependent change, but, importantly, do not alter the rate of phenotypic change. Hence, these PAAIs have limited effects on aging.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of metformin on diabetes prevention and the subgroups that benefited most over 15 years in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and its follow-up, the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During the DPP (1996-2001), adults at high risk of developing diabetes were randomly assigned to masked placebo (n = 1,082) or metformin 850 mg twice daily (n = 1,073). Participants originally assigned to metformin continued to receive metformin, unmasked, in the DPPOS (2002-present). Ascertainment of diabetes development was based on fasting or 2-h glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test or on HbA1c. Reduction in diabetes incidence with metformin was compared with placebo in subgroups by hazard ratio (HR) and rate differences (RDs).
RESULTS: During 15 years of postrandomization follow-up, metformin reduced the incidence (by HR) of diabetes compared to placebo by 17\% or 36\% based on glucose or HbA1c levels, respectively. Metformin's effect on the development of glucose-defined diabetes was greater for women with a history of prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (HR 0.59, RD -4.57 cases/100 person-years) compared with parous women without GDM (HR 0.94, RD -0.38 cases/100 person-years [interaction P = 0.03 for HR, P = 0.01 for RD]). Metformin also had greater effects, by HR and RD, at higher baseline fasting glucose levels. With diabetes development based on HbA1c, metformin was more effective in subjects with higher baseline HbA1c by RD, with metformin RD -1.03 cases/100 person-years with baseline HbA1c {\textless}6.0\% (42 mmol/mol) and -3.88 cases/100 person-years with 6.0-6.4\% (P = 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin reduces the development of diabetes over 15 years. The subsets that benefitted the most include subjects with higher baseline fasting glucose or HbA1c and women with a history of GDM.},

We report the effects of lifelong treatment of mice with four agents not previously tested: Protandim, fish oil, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and metformin - the latter with and without rapamycin, and two drugs previously examined: 17-α-estradiol and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), at doses greater and less than used previously. 17-α-estradiol at a threefold higher dose robustly extended both median and maximal lifespan, but still only in males. The male-specific extension of median lifespan by NDGA was replicated at the original dose, and using doses threefold lower and higher. The effects of NDGA were dose dependent and male specific but without an effect on maximal lifespan. Protandim, a mixture of botanical extracts that activate Nrf2, extended median lifespan in males only. Metformin alone, at a dose of 0.1\% in the diet, did not significantly extend lifespan. Metformin (0.1\%) combined with rapamycin (14 ppm) robustly extended lifespan, suggestive of an added benefit, based on historical comparison with earlier studies of rapamycin given alone. The α-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose, at a concentration previously tested (1000 ppm), significantly increased median longevity in males and 90th percentile lifespan in both sexes, even when treatment was started at 16 months. Neither fish oil nor UDCA extended lifespan. These results underscore the reproducibility of ITP longevity studies and illustrate the importance of identifying optimal doses in lifespan studies.},

	abstract = {The accurate calculation of the binding free energy for arbitrary ligand–protein pairs is a considerable challenge in computer-aided drug discovery. Recently, it has been demonstrated that current state-of-the-art molecular dynamics (MD) based methods are capable of making highly accurate predictions. Conventional MD-based approaches rely on the first principles of statistical mechanics and assume equilibrium sampling of the phase space. In the current work we demonstrate that accurate absolute binding free energies (ABFE) can also be obtained via theoretically rigorous non-equilibrium approaches. Our investigation of ligands binding to bromodomains and T4 lysozyme reveals that both equilibrium and non-equilibrium approaches converge to the same results. The non-equilibrium approach achieves the same level of accuracy and convergence as an equilibrium free energy perturbation (FEP) method enhanced by Hamiltonian replica exchange. We also compare uni- and bi-directional non-equilibrium approaches and demonstrate that considering the work distributions from both forward and reverse directions provides substantial accuracy gains. In summary, non-equilibrium ABFE calculations are shown to yield reliable and well-converged estimates of protein–ligand binding affinity.},

Their goal was to develop predictive bioactivity signatures for toxic compounds using a set of in vitro assays and/or in silico properties. In 2009, Pfizer joined the ToxCast initiative by contributing 52 compounds with preclinical and clinical data for profiling across the multiple assay platforms available. Here, we describe the initial analysis of the Pfizer subset of compounds within the ToxCast chemical (n = 1814) and in vitro assay (n = 486) space. An analysis of the hit rate of Pfizer compounds in the ToxCast assay panel allowed us to focus our mining of assays potentially most relevant to the attrition of our compounds. We compared the bioactivity profile of Pfizer compounds to other compounds in the ToxCast chemical space to gain insights into common toxicity pathways. Additionally, we explored the similarity in the chemical and biological spaces between drug-like compounds and environmental chemicals in ToxCast and compared the in vivo profiles of a subset of failed pharmaceuticals having high similarity in both spaces. We found differences in the chemical and biological spaces of pharmaceuticals compared to environmental chemicals, which may question the applicability of bioactivity signatures developed exclusively based on the latter to drug-like compounds if used without prior validation with the ToxCast Phase-II chemicals. Finally, our analysis has allowed us to identify novel interactions for our compounds in particular with multiple nuclear receptors that were previously not known. This insight may help us to identify potential liabilities with future novel compounds.},

Each dose led to a significant change (by log-rank test) in both sexes, with larger effects in males, consistent with the original report. There were no significant differences among the three doses. The two higher doses produced 16\% or 17\% increases in median longevity of males, but only 4\% or 5\% increases in females. Age at the 90th percentile was increased significantly (8\%-11\%) in males at each dose, but was significantly increased (3\%) in females only at 1,000 ppm. The sex effect on longevity is not explained simply by weight or fat mass, which were reduced by ACA more in females than in males. ACA at 1,000 ppm reduced lung tumors in males, diminished liver degeneration in both sexes and glomerulosclerosis in females, reduced blood glucose responses to refeeding in males, and improved rotarod performance in aging females, but not males. Three other interventions were also tested: ursolic acid, 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBX), and INT-767; none of these affected lifespan at the doses tested. The acarbose results confirm and extend our original report, prompt further attention to the effects of transient periods of high blood glucose on aging and the diseases of aging, including cancer, and should motivate studies of acarbose and other glucose-control drugs in humans.},

	abstract = {We present CryoGAN, a new paradigm for single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction based on unsupervised deep adversarial learning. In single-particle cryo-EM, the structure of a biomolecule needs to be reconstructed from a large set of noisy tomographic projections with unknown orientations. Current reconstruction techniques are based on a marginalized maximum-likelihood formulation that requires calculations over the set of all possible poses for each projection image, a computationally demanding procedure. Our approach is to seek a 3D structure that has simulated projections that match the real data in a distributional sense, thereby sidestepping pose estimation or marginalization. We prove that, in an idealized mathematical model of cryo-EM, this approach results in recovery of the correct structure. Motivated by distribution matching, we propose CryoGAN, a specialized GAN that consists of a 3D structure, a cryo-EM physics simulator, and a discriminator neural network. During reconstruction, the 3D structure is optimized so that its projections obtained through the simulator resemble real data (to the discriminator). Simultaneously, the discriminator is trained to distinguish real projections from simulated projections. CryoGAN takes as input only real projection images and the distribution of the cryo-EM imaging parameters. It involves neither prior training nor an initial estimation of the 3D structure. CryoGAN currently achieves a 10.8 Å resolution on a realistic synthetic dataset. Preliminary results on experimental β-galactosidase and 80S ribosome data demonstrate the ability of CryoGAN to exploit data statistics under standard experimental imaging conditions. We believe that this paradigm opens the door to a family of novel likelihood-free algorithms for cryo-EM reconstruction.},

Here, to facilitate the integration of any medical data from any data owner worldwide without violating privacy laws, we introduce Swarm Learning—a decentralized machine-learning approach that unites edge computing, blockchain-based peer-to-peer networking and coordination while maintaining confidentiality without the need for a central coordinator, thereby going beyond federated learning. To illustrate the feasibility of using Swarm Learning to develop disease classifiers using distributed data, we chose four use cases of heterogeneous diseases (COVID-19, tuberculosis, leukaemia and lung pathologies). With more than 16,400 blood transcriptomes derived from 127 clinical studies with non-uniform distributions of cases and controls and substantial study biases, as well as more than 95,000 chest X-ray images, we show that Swarm Learning classifiers outperform those developed at individual sites. In addition, Swarm Learning completely fulfils local confidentiality regulations by design. We believe that this approach will notably accelerate the introduction of precision medicine.},

	abstract = {Equilibrium fluctuations and triggered conformational changes often underlie the functional cycles of membrane proteins. For example, transporters mediate the passage of molecules across cell membranes by alternating between inward- and outward-facing states, while receptors undergo intracellular structural rearrangements that initiate signaling cascades. Although the conformational plasticity of these proteins has historically posed a challenge for traditional de novo protein structure prediction pipelines, the recent success of AlphaFold2 (AF2) in CASP14 culminated in the modeling of a transporter in multiple conformations to high accuracy. Given that AF2 was designed to predict static structures of proteins, it remains unclear if this result represents an underexplored capability to accurately predict multiple conformations and/or structural heterogeneity. Here, we present an approach to drive AF2 to sample alternative conformations of topologically diverse transporters and G-protein-coupled receptors that are absent from the AF2 training set. Whereas models of most proteins generated using the default AF2 pipeline are conformationally homogeneous and nearly identical to one another, reducing the depth of the input multiple sequence alignments by stochastic subsampling led to the generation of accurate models in multiple conformations. In our benchmark, these conformations spanned the range between two experimental structures of interest, with models at the extremes of these conformational distributions observed to be among the most accurate (average template modeling score of 0.94). These results suggest a straightforward approach to identifying native-like alternative states, while also highlighting the need for the next generation of deep learning algorithms to be designed to predict ensembles of biophysically relevant states.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btq112},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurately predicting the binding affinities of large sets of diverse protein-ligand complexes is an extremely challenging task. The scoring functions that attempt such computational prediction are essential for analysing the outputs of molecular docking, which in turn is an important technique for drug discovery, chemical biology and structural biology. Each scoring function assumes a predetermined theory-inspired functional form for the relationship between the variables that characterize the complex, which also include parameters fitted to experimental or simulation data and its predicted binding affinity. The inherent problem of this rigid approach is that it leads to poor predictivity for those complexes that do not conform to the modelling assumptions. Moreover, resampling strategies, such as cross-validation or bootstrapping, are still not systematically used to guard against the overfitting of calibration data in parameter estimation for scoring functions.
RESULTS: We propose a novel scoring function (RF-Score) that circumvents the need for problematic modelling assumptions via non-parametric machine learning. In particular, Random Forest was used to implicitly capture binding effects that are hard to model explicitly. RF-Score is compared with the state of the art on the demanding PDBbind benchmark. Results show that RF-Score is a very competitive scoring function. Importantly, RF-Score's performance was shown to improve dramatically with training set size and hence the future availability of more high-quality structural and interaction data is expected to lead to improved versions of RF-Score.

Here we report our implementation of automated large-scale FEP calculations, using the Amber software package, to facilitate antibody design and evaluation. In combination with Hamiltonian replica exchange, our FEP simulations aim to predict the effect of mutations on both the binding affinity and the structural stability. Importantly, we incorporate multiple strategies to faithfully estimate the statistical uncertainties in the FEP results. As a case study, we apply our protocols to systematically evaluate variants of the m396 antibody for their conformational stability and their binding affinity to the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. By properly adjusting relevant parameters, the particle collapse problems in the FEP simulations are avoided. Furthermore, large statistical errors in a small fraction of the FEP calculations are effectively reduced by extending the sampling, such that acceptable statistical uncertainties are achieved for the vast majority of the cases with a modest total computational cost. Finally, our predicted conformational stability for the m396 variants is qualitatively consistent with the experimentally measured melting temperatures. Our work thus demonstrates the applicability of FEP in computational antibody design.},

Such alternative attractors, as for example equilibria and cycles, have been found in the dynamics of experimental systems. Yet, for natural systems, where multiple biotic and abiotic factors simultaneously affect population dynamics, it is more challenging to distinguish alternative dynamical behaviors. Although recent research exemplifies that some natural systems can exhibit alternative states, a robust methodology for testing whether these constitute distinct dynamical attractors is currently lacking. Here, using attractor reconstruction techniques we develop such a test. Applications of the methodology to simulated, experimental and natural time series data, reveal that alternative dynamical behaviors are hard to distinguish if population dynamics are governed by purely stochastic processes. However, if population dynamics are brought about also by mechanisms internal to the system, alternative attractors can readily be detected. Since many natural populations display evidence of such internally driven dynamics, our approach offers a method for empirically testing whether ecosystems exhibit alternative dynamical attractors.},

At the same time, rational design by high-throughput (HT) simulations is another forefront of MD. In these areas, the Martini coarse-grained force field, especially the latest version (i.e. v3), is being actively explored because it offers enhanced spatial-temporal resolution. However, the automation tools for preparing simulations with the Martini force field, accompanying the previous version, were not designed for HT simulations or studies of complex cellular systems. Therefore, they become a major limiting factor. To address these shortcomings, we present the open-source Vermouth python library. Vermouth is designed to become the unified framework for developing programs, which prepare, run, and analyze Martini simulations of complex systems. To demonstrate the power of the Vermouth library, the Martinize2 program is showcased as a generalization of the martinize script, originally aimed to set up simulations of proteins. In contrast to the previous version, Martinize2 automatically handles protonation states in proteins and post-translation modifications, offers more options to fine-tune structural biases such as the elastic network, and can convert non-protein molecules such as ligands. Finally, Martinize2 is used to convert the entire I-TASSER protein template database as high-complexity benchmark and illustrate how the checks on input structure quality can safe guard high-throughput applications.},

	abstract = {The National Institute on Aging's Interventions Testing Program was established to evaluate agents that are purported to increase lifespan and delay the appearance of age-related disease in genetically heterogeneous mice. Up to five compounds are added to the study each year and each compound is tested at three test sites (The Jackson Laboratory, University of Michigan, and University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio). Mice in the first cohort were exposed to one of four agents: aspirin, nitroflurbiprofen, 4-OH-alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone, or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA). Sample size was sufficient to detect a 10\% difference in lifespan in either sex,with 80\% power, using data from two of the three sites. Pooling data from all three sites, a log-rank test showed that both NDGA (p=0.0006) and aspirin (p=0.01) led to increased lifespan of male mice. Comparison of the proportion of live mice at the age of 90\% mortality was used as a surrogate for measurement of maximum lifespan;neither NDGA (p=0.12) nor aspirin (p=0.16) had a significant effect in this test. Measures of blood levels of NDGA or aspirin and its salicylic acid metabolite suggest that the observed lack of effects of NDGA or aspirin on life span in females could be related to gender differences in drug disposition or metabolism. Further studies are warranted to find whether NDGA or aspirin, over a range of doses,might prove to postpone death and various age-related outcomes reproducibly in mice.},

Among women in the DPP, diabetes risk reduction with metformin was greater in women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared with women without GDM but with one or more previous live births. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We asked if genetic variability could account for these differences by comparing β-cell function and genetic risk scores (GRS), calculated from 34 diabetes-associated loci, between women with and without histories of GDM. RESULTS β-Cell function was reduced in women with GDM. The GRS was positively associated with a history of GDM; however, the GRS did not predict progression to diabetes or modulate response to intervention. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that a diabetes-associated GRS is associated with development of GDM and may characterize women at risk for development of diabetes due to β-cell dysfunction.},

In particular, much attention has been paid to improving its efficiency on problems with many parameters to optimize. This attention has trickled down to the workhorse of high dimensional BO, high dimensional Gaussian process regression, which is also of independent interest. The great flexibility that the Gaussian process prior implies is a boon when modeling complicated, low dimensional surfaces but simply says too little when dimension grows too large. A variety of structural model assumptions have been tested to tame high dimensions, from variable selection and additive decomposition to low dimensional embeddings and beyond. Most of these approaches in turn require modifications of the acquisition function optimization strategy as well. Here we review the defining structural model assumptions and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of these approaches in practice.},

This work presents MedSAM, the first attempt at extending the success of SAM to medical images, with the goal of creating a universal tool for the segmentation of various medical targets. Specifically, we first curate a large-scale medical image dataset, encompassing over 200,000 masks across 11 different modalities. Then, we develop a simple fine-tuning method to adapt SAM to general medical image segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on 21 3D segmentation tasks and 9 2D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAM outperforms the default SAM model with an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 22.5\% and 17.6\% on 3D and 2D segmentation tasks, respectively.

	abstract = {The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is the first foundation model for general image segmentation. It designed a novel promotable segmentation task, ensuring zero-shot image segmentation using the pre-trained model via two main modes including automatic everything and manual prompt. SAM has achieved impressive results on various natural image segmentation tasks. However, medical image segmentation (MIS) is more challenging due to the complex modalities, fine anatomical structures, uncertain and complex object boundaries, and wide-range object scales. Meanwhile, zero-shot and efficient MIS can well reduce the annotation time and boost the development of medical image analysis. Hence, SAM seems to be a potential tool and its performance on large medical datasets should be further validated. We collected and sorted 52 open-source datasets, and built a large medical segmentation dataset with 16 modalities, 68 objects, and 553K slices. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of different SAM testing strategies on the so-called COSMOS 553K dataset. Extensive experiments validate that SAM performs better with manual hints like points and boxes for object perception in medical images, leading to better performance in prompt mode compared to everything mode. Additionally, SAM shows remarkable performance in some specific objects and modalities, but is imperfect or even totally fails in other situations. Finally, we analyze the influence of different factors (e.g., the Fourier-based boundary complexity and size of the segmented objects) on SAM's segmentation performance. Extensive experiments validate that SAM's zero-shot segmentation capability is not sufficient to ensure its direct application to the MIS.},

Core Results: The results suggest that the zero-shot SAM model achieves remarkable segmentation performance for large connected objects. However, it does not consistently achieve satisfying performance for dense instance object segmentation, even with 20 prompts (clicks/boxes) on each image. We also summarized the identified limitations for digital pathology: (1) image resolution, (2) multiple scales, (3) prompt selection, and (4) model fine-tuning.

There has recently been an explosion of research aiming not only to improve the accuracy rates of federated learning, but also provide certain guarantees around social good properties such as total error. One branch of this research has taken a game-theoretic approach, and in particular, prior work has viewed federated learning as a hedonic game, where error-minimizing players arrange themselves into federating coalitions. This past work proves the existence of stable coalition partitions, but leaves open a wide range of questions, including how far from optimal these stable solutions are. In this work, we motivate and define a notion of optimality given by the average error rates among federating agents (players). First, we provide and prove the correctness of an efficient algorithm to calculate an optimal (error minimizing) arrangement of players. Next, we analyze the relationship between the stability and optimality of an arrangement. First, we show that for some regions of parameter space, all stable arrangements are optimal (Price of Anarchy equal to 1). However, we show this is not true for all settings: there exist examples of stable arrangements with higher cost than optimal (Price of Anarchy greater than 1). Finally, we give the first constant-factor bound on the performance gap between stability and optimality, proving that the total error of the worst stable solution can be no higher than 9 times the total error of an optimal solution (Price of Anarchy bound of 9).},

Although numerous beneficial effects have been attributed to this plant, several case reports have demonstrated high doses of Larrea-containing herbals induce hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in humans. Nordihydriguaiaretic acid (NDGA) is a lignan found in high amounts (up to 10\% by dry weight) in the leaves and twigs of L. tridentata. Previously, NDGA has been shown to induce cystic nephropathy in the rat, however, no reports have been made concerning this compound's hepatotoxic potential. Here, we report that intraperitoneal administration of NDGA is lethal in the mouse (LD(50)=75 mg/kg). Administration is associated with a time and dose-dependent increase in serum alanine aminotransferase levels, which suggest liver damage. Indeed, freshly isolated mouse hepatocytes are more sensitive to NDGA than human melanoma cells. Furthermore, we have identified glucuronidation as a potential detoxification mechanism for NDGA. Both mono and diglucuronide conjugates of NDGA are formed after intravenous dosing. The monoglucuronide is also formed after incubation of NDGA with human hepatic microsomes; suggesting that glucuronide conjugation is important in the metabolism of NDGA by humans. In summary, this report indicates that NDGA may contribute to the hepatotoxicity of L. tridentata and provides preliminary information on NDGA metabolism.},

Here, we demonstrate the successful use of SL in large, multicentric datasets of gigapixel histopathology images from over 5,000 patients. We show that AI models trained using SL can predict BRAF mutational status and microsatellite instability directly from hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E)-stained pathology slides of colorectal cancer. We trained AI models on three patient cohorts from Northern Ireland, Germany and the United States, and validated the prediction performance in two independent datasets from the United Kingdom. Our data show that SL-trained AI models outperform most locally trained models, and perform on par with models that are trained on the merged datasets. In addition, we show that SL-based AI models are data efficient. In the future, SL can be used to train distributed AI models for any histopathology image analysis task, eliminating the need for data transfer.},

We consider large language models for generative chemistry and graph neural networks for machine-learned interatomic potentials. To enable large-scale scientific deep learning studies under resource constraints, we develop the Training Performance Estimation (TPE) framework to reduce the costs of scalable hyperparameter optimization by up to 90\%. Using this framework, we discover empirical neural scaling relations for deep chemical models and investigate the interplay between physical priors and scale.

We show that XAI methods like chemical counterfactuals and descriptor explanations can both explain DL predictions and give insight into structure-property relationships. Finally, we discuss how a two step process of highly accurate black-box modeling and then creating explanations gives both highly accurate predictions and clear structure-property relationships.},

However, the security of federated learning is increasingly being questioned, due to the malicious clients or central servers' constant attack to the global model or user privacy data. To address these security issues, we proposed a decentralized federated learning framework based on blockchain, i.e., a Blockchain-based Federated Learning framework with Committee consensus (BFLC). The framework uses blockchain for the global model storage and the local model update exchange. To enable the proposed BFLC, we also devised an innovative committee consensus mechanism, which can effectively reduce the amount of consensus computing and reduce malicious attacks. We then discussed the scalability of BFLC, including theoretical security, storage optimization, and incentives. Finally, we performed experiments using real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of the BFLC framework.},

One of the important challenges in this setting is data heterogeneity, i.e. different users have different data characteristics. For this reason, training and using a single global model might be suboptimal when considering the performance of each of the individual user's data. In this work, we tackle this problem via Federated Mixture of Experts, FedMix, a framework that allows us to train an ensemble of specialized models. FedMix adaptively selects and trains a user-specific selection of the ensemble members. We show that users with similar data characteristics select the same members and therefore share statistical strength while mitigating the effect of non-i.i.d data. Empirically, we show through an extensive experimental evaluation that FedMix improves performance compared to using a single global model across a variety of different sources of non-i.i.d.-ness.},

In this problem, nodes start each with an initial vector and seek to approximately agree on a common vector, which is close to the average of honest nodes' initial vectors. We present two asynchronous solutions to averaging agreement, each we prove optimal according to some dimension. The first, based on the minimum-diameter averaging, requires \$ n {\textbackslash}geq 6f+1\$, but achieves asymptotically the best-possible averaging constant up to a multiplicative constant. The second, based on reliable broadcast and coordinate-wise trimmed mean, achieves optimal Byzantine resilience, i.e., \$n {\textbackslash}geq 3f+1\$.

Computational docking approaches have been widely used to predict drug binding targets; yet, such approaches depend on existing protein structures, and accurate structural predictions have only recently become available from AlphaFold2. Here, we combine AlphaFold2 with molecular docking simulations to predict protein-ligand interactions between 296 proteins spanning Escherichia coli's essential proteome, and 218 active antibacterial compounds and 100 inactive compounds, respectively, pointing to widespread compound and protein promiscuity. We benchmark model performance by measuring enzymatic activity for 12 essential proteins treated with each antibacterial compound. We confirm extensive promiscuity, but find that the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) is 0.48, indicating weak model performance. We demonstrate that rescoring of docking poses using machine learning-based approaches improves model performance, resulting in average auROCs as large as 0.63, and that ensembles of rescoring functions improve prediction accuracy and the ratio of true-positive rate to false-positive rate. This work indicates that advances in modeling protein-ligand interactions, particularly using machine learning-based approaches, are needed to better harness AlphaFold2 for drug discovery.},

We propose structure‒tissue exposure/selectivity–activity relationship (STAR) to improve drug optimization, which classifies drug candidates based on drug's potency/selectivity, tissue exposure/selectivity, and required dose for balancing clinical efficacy/toxicity. Class I drugs have high specificity/potency and high tissue exposure/selectivity, which needs low dose to achieve superior clinical efficacy/safety with high success rate. Class II drugs have high specificity/potency and low tissue exposure/selectivity, which requires high dose to achieve clinical efficacy with high toxicity and needs to be cautiously evaluated. Class III drugs have relatively low (adequate) specificity/potency but high tissue exposure/selectivity, which requires low dose to achieve clinical efficacy with manageable toxicity but are often overlooked. Class IV drugs have low specificity/potency and low tissue exposure/selectivity, which achieves inadequate efficacy/safety, and should be terminated early.

Because mechanisms that are meant to promote cellular longevity tend to decrease in effectiveness with age, it is no surprise that aging presents as a major risk factor for many diseases such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and diabetes. Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the intracellular antioxidant and overproduction of reactive oxygen species, is known to promote the aging process. Autophagy, a major pathway for protein turnover, is considered as one of the hallmarks of aging. Given the progressive physiologic degeneration and increased risk for disease that accompanies aging, many studies have attempted to discover new compounds that may aid in the reversal of the aging process. Here, we summarize the antiaging mechanism of natural or naturally derived synthetic compounds involving oxidative stress and autophagy. These compounds include: 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) derivatives (synthetic triterpenoids derived from naturally occurring oleanolic acid), caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE, the active ingredient in honey bee propolis), xanthohumol (a prenylated flavonoid identified in the hops plant), guggulsterone (a plant steroid found in the resin of the guggul plant), resveratrol (a natural phenol abundantly found in grape), and sulforaphane (a sulfur-containing compound found in cruciferous vegetables).},

We aim to fill this gap by introducing a novel benchmark suite for ML MD simulation. We curate representative MD systems, including water, organic molecules, peptide, and materials, and design evaluation metrics corresponding to the scientific objectives of respective systems. We benchmark a collection of state-of-the-art (SOTA) ML FF models and illustrate, in particular, how the commonly benchmarked force accuracy is not well aligned with relevant simulation metrics. We demonstrate when and how selected SOTA methods fail, along with offering directions for further improvement. Specifically, we identify stability as a key metric for ML models to improve. Our benchmark suite comes with a comprehensive open-source codebase for training and simulation with ML FFs to facilitate further work.},

Such graph generative models usually consist of two steps: learning latent representations and generation of molecular graphs. However, to generate novel and chemically-valid molecular graphs from latent representations is very challenging because of the chemical constraints and combinatorial complexity of molecular graphs. In this paper, we propose MoFlow, a flow-based graph generative model to learn invertible mappings between molecular graphs and their latent representations. To generate molecular graphs, our MoFlow first generates bonds (edges) through a Glow based model, then generates atoms (nodes) given bonds by a novel graph conditional flow, and finally assembles them into a chemically valid molecular graph with a posthoc validity correction. Our MoFlow has merits including exact and tractable likelihood training, efficient one-pass embedding and generation, chemical validity guarantees, 100{\textbackslash}\% reconstruction of training data, and good generalization ability. We validate our model by four tasks: molecular graph generation and reconstruction, visualization of the continuous latent space, property optimization, and constrained property optimization. Our MoFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, which implies its potential efficiency and effectiveness to explore large chemical space for drug discovery.},

By composing these models, we aim to improve our ability to evaluate unseen mutations and constrain search to regions of sequence space likely to contain functional proteins. Our framework achieves this without any model fine-tuning or re-training by constructing a product of experts distribution directly in discrete protein space. Instead of resorting to brute force search or random sampling, which is typical of classic directed evolution, we introduce a fast MCMC sampler that uses gradients to propose promising mutations. We conduct in silico directed evolution experiments on wide fitness landscapes and across a range of different pre-trained unsupervised models, including a 650M parameter protein language model. Our results demonstrate an ability to efficiently discover variants with high evolutionary likelihood as well as estimated activity multiple mutations away from a wild type protein, suggesting our sampler provides a practical and effective new paradigm for machine-learning-based protein engineering.},

In this paper, we formulate SBDD as a 3D-conditional generation problem and present DiffSBDD, an E(3)-equivariant 3D-conditional diffusion model that generates novel ligands conditioned on protein pockets. Furthermore, we curate a new dataset of experimentally determined binding complex data from Binding MOAD to provide a realistic binding scenario that complements the synthetic CrossDocked dataset.

	abstract = {Proteins are macromolecules that perform essential functions in all living organisms. Designing novel proteins with specific structures and desired functions has been a long-standing challenge in the field of bioengineering. Existing approaches generate both protein sequence and structure using either autoregressive models or diffusion models, both of which suffer from high inference costs. In this paper, we propose a new approach capable of protein sequence and structure co-design, which iteratively translates both protein sequence and structure into the desired state from random initialization, based on context features given a priori. Our model consists of a trigonometry-aware encoder that reasons geometrical constraints and interactions from context features, and a roto-translation equivariant decoder that translates protein sequence and structure interdependently. Notably, all protein amino acids are updated in one shot in each translation step, which significantly accelerates the inference process. Experimental results across multiple tasks show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin, and is able to design proteins of high fidelity as regards both sequence and structure, with running time orders of magnitude less than sampling-based methods.},

	abstract = {We study a fundamental problem in structure-based drug design -- generating molecules that bind to specific protein binding sites. While we have witnessed the great success of deep generative models in drug design, the existing methods are mostly string-based or graph-based. They are limited by the lack of spatial information and thus unable to be applied to structure-based design tasks. Particularly, such models have no or little knowledge of how molecules interact with their target proteins exactly in 3D space. In this paper, we propose a 3D generative model that generates molecules given a designated 3D protein binding site. Specifically, given a binding site as the 3D context, our model estimates the probability density of atom's occurrences in 3D space -- positions that are more likely to have atoms will be assigned higher probability. To generate 3D molecules, we propose an auto-regressive sampling scheme -- atoms are sampled sequentially from the learned distribution until there is no room for new atoms. Combined with this sampling scheme, our model can generate valid and diverse molecules, which could be applicable to various structure-based molecular design tasks such as molecule sampling and linker design. Experimental results demonstrate that molecules sampled from our model exhibit high binding affinity to specific targets and good drug properties such as drug-likeness even if the model is not explicitly optimized for them.},

	abstract = {Molecular docking, given a ligand molecule and a ligand binding site (called ``pocket'') on a protein, predicting the binding mode of the protein-ligand complex, is a widely used technique in drug design. Many deep learning models have been developed for molecular docking, while most existing deep learning models perform docking on the whole protein, rather than on a given pocket as the traditional molecular docking approaches, which does not match common needs. What's more, they claim to perform better than traditional molecular docking, but the approach of comparison is not fair, since traditional methods are not designed for docking on the whole protein without a given pocket. In this paper, we design a series of experiments to examine the actual performance of these deep learning models and traditional methods. For a fair comparison, we decompose the docking on the whole protein into two steps, pocket searching and docking on a given pocket, and build pipelines to evaluate traditional methods and deep learning methods respectively. We find that deep learning models are actually good at pocket searching, but traditional methods are better than deep learning models at docking on given pockets. Overall, our work explicitly reveals some potential problems in current deep learning models for molecular docking and provides several suggestions for future works.},

However, their predictive quality at activity prediction is lacking. In this work, we envision a novel type of activity prediction model that is able to adapt to new prediction tasks at inference time, via understanding textual information describing the task. To this end, we propose a new architecture with separate modules for chemical and natural language inputs, and a contrastive pre-training objective on data from large biochemical databases.

Here we introduce the steps required to build machine-learning sequence–function models and to use those models to guide engineering, making recommendations at each stage. This review covers basic concepts relevant to the use of machine learning for protein engineering, as well as the current literature and applications of this engineering paradigm.

Previous sampling algorithms either sample in the graph space or only consider the 3D coordinates of atoms while ignoring other detailed chemical structures such as bond types and functional groups. To address the challenge, we develop Pocket2Mol, an E(3)-equivariant generative network composed of two modules: 1) a new graph neural network capturing both spatial and bonding relationships between atoms of the binding pockets and 2) a new efficient algorithm which samples new drug candidates conditioned on the pocket representations from a tractable distribution without relying on MCMC.

	abstract = {Comparison of ligand poses generated by protein–ligand docking programs has often been carried out with the assumption of direct atomic correspondence between ligand structures. However, this correspondence is not necessarily chemically relevant for symmetric molecules and can lead to an artificial inflation of ligand pose distance metrics, particularly those that depend on receptor superposition (rather than ligand superposition), such as docking root mean square deviation (RMSD). Several of the commonly-used RMSD calculation algorithms that correct for molecular symmetry do not take into account the bonding structure of molecules and can therefore result in non-physical atomic mapping. Here, we present DockRMSD, a docking pose distance calculator that converts the symmetry correction to a graph isomorphism searching problem, in which the optimal atomic mapping and RMSD calculation are performed by an exhaustive and fast matching search of all isomorphisms of the ligand structure graph. We show through evaluation of docking poses generated by AutoDock Vina on the CSAR Hi-Q set that DockRMSD is capable of deterministically identifying the minimum symmetry-corrected RMSD and is able to do so without significant loss of computational efficiency compared to other methods. The open-source DockRMSD program can be conveniently integrated with various docking pipelines to assist with accurate atomic mapping and RMSD calculations, which can therefore help improve docking performance, especially for ligand molecules with complicated structural symmetry.},

(2016) showed one interesting way to synthesize novel images by performing gradient ascent in the latent space of a generator network to maximize the activations of one or multiple neurons in a separate classifier network. In this paper we extend this method by introducing an additional prior on the latent code, improving both sample quality and sample diversity, leading to a state-of-the-art generative model that produces high quality images at higher resolutions (227x227) than previous generative models, and does so for all 1000 ImageNet categories. In addition, we provide a unified probabilistic interpretation of related activation maximization methods and call the general class of models "Plug and Play Generative Networks". PPGNs are composed of 1) a generator network G that is capable of drawing a wide range of image types and 2) a replaceable "condition" network C that tells the generator what to draw. We demonstrate the generation of images conditioned on a class (when C is an ImageNet or MIT Places classification network) and also conditioned on a caption (when C is an image captioning network). Our method also improves the state of the art of Multifaceted Feature Visualization, which generates the set of synthetic inputs that activate a neuron in order to better understand how deep neural networks operate. Finally, we show that our model performs reasonably well at the task of image inpainting. While image models are used in this paper, the approach is modality-agnostic and can be applied to many types of data.},

We then develop a variational Bayesian neural network to perform ordinal regression on a set of the directed evolution sequences binned by off-rate and quantify their likelihood to be tight binders against an antigen. Importantly, this model can assess sequences not present in the directed evolution library and thus greatly expand the search space to uncover the best sequences for experimental evaluation. We demonstrate the power of this pipeline by achieving a 17-fold improvement in the KD of the PD-L1 antibody Atezolizumab and this success illustrates the potential of RESP in facilitating general antibody development.},

To answer this question, we have developed a general theoretical framework to investigate the representation power of INNs, building on a structure theorem of differential geometry. The framework simplifies the approximation problem of diffeomorphisms, which enables us to show the universal approximation properties of INNs.

Our empirical analysis reveals that supervised learning generalizes poorly to new attributes, but a combination of self-supervised pretraining with supervised finetuning leads to stronger generalization. The benefit of self-supervised pretraining and supervised finetuning is further investigated through controlled experiments using random splits of the attribute space, and we find that predictability of test attributes provides an informative estimate of a model's generalization ability.},

	abstract = {Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-experts (MoE) models allow the number of parameters to greatly increase while keeping the amount of computation for a given token or a given sample unchanged. However, a poor expert routing strategy (e.g. one resulting in load imbalance) can cause certain experts to be under-trained, leading to an expert being under or over-specialized. Prior work allocates a fixed number of experts to each token using a top-k function regardless of the relative importance of different tokens. To address this, we propose a heterogeneous mixture-of-experts employing an expert choice method. Instead of letting tokens select the top-k experts, we have experts selecting the top-k tokens. As a result, each token can be routed to a variable number of experts and each expert can have a fixed bucket size. We systematically study pre-training speedups using the same computational resources of the Switch Transformer top-1 and GShard top-2 gating of prior work and find that our method improves training convergence time by more than 2x. For the same computational cost, our method demonstrates higher performance in fine-tuning 11 selected tasks in the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks. For a smaller activation cost, our method outperforms the T5 dense model in 7 out of the 11 tasks.},

	abstract = {An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.},

	abstract = {Large transformer-based language models (LMs) trained on huge text corpora have shown unparalleled generation capabilities. However, controlling attributes of the generated language (e.g. switching topic or sentiment) is difficult without modifying the model architecture or fine-tuning on attribute-specific data and entailing the significant cost of retraining. We propose a simple alternative: the Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) for controllable language generation, which combines a pretrained LM with one or more simple attribute classifiers that guide text generation without any further training of the LM. In the canonical scenario we present, the attribute models are simple classifiers consisting of a user-specified bag of words or a single learned layer with 100,000 times fewer parameters than the LM. Sampling entails a forward and backward pass in which gradients from the attribute model push the LM's hidden activations and thus guide the generation. Model samples demonstrate control over a range of topics and sentiment styles, and extensive automated and human annotated evaluations show attribute alignment and fluency. PPLMs are flexible in that any combination of differentiable attribute models may be used to steer text generation, which will allow for diverse and creative applications beyond the examples given in this paper.},

	abstract = {Understanding document images (e.g., invoices) is a core but challenging task since it requires complex functions such as reading text and a holistic understanding of the document. Current Visual Document Understanding (VDU) methods outsource the task of reading text to off-the-shelf Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engines and focus on the understanding task with the OCR outputs. Although such OCR-based approaches have shown promising performance, they suffer from 1) high computational costs for using OCR; 2) inflexibility of OCR models on languages or types of document; 3) OCR error propagation to the subsequent process. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel OCR-free VDU model named Donut, which stands for Document understanding transformer. As the first step in OCR-free VDU research, we propose a simple architecture (i.e., Transformer) with a pre-training objective (i.e., cross-entropy loss). Donut is conceptually simple yet effective. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we show a simple OCR-free VDU model, Donut, achieves state-of-the-art performances on various VDU tasks in terms of both speed and accuracy. In addition, we offer a synthetic data generator that helps the model pre-training to be flexible in various languages and domains.

However, identifying maximally robust or causal features may be difficult in some scenarios, and in others, non-causal "shortcut" features may actually be more predictive. We propose a lightweight, sample-efficient approach that learns a diverse set of features and adapts to a target distribution by interpolating these features with a small target dataset. Our approach, Project and Probe (Pro\${\textasciicircum}2\$), first learns a linear projection that maps a pre-trained embedding onto orthogonal directions while being predictive of labels in the source dataset. The goal of this step is to learn a variety of predictive features, so that at least some of them remain useful after distribution shift. Pro\${\textasciicircum}2\$ then learns a linear classifier on top of these projected features using a small target dataset. We theoretically show that Pro\${\textasciicircum}2\$ learns a projection matrix that is optimal for classification in an information-theoretic sense, resulting in better generalization due to a favorable bias-variance tradeoff. Our experiments on four datasets, with multiple distribution shift settings for each, show that Pro\${\textasciicircum}2\$ improves performance by 5-15\% when given limited target data compared to prior methods such as standard linear probing.},

In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related AI technology, increasing transparency into how well AI technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.},

A new development in the century-old question about the spectrum-geometry relationship is provided. Novel algebraic graph learning score (AGL-Score) models are proposed to encode high-dimensional physical and biological information into intrinsically low-dimensional representations. The proposed AGL-Score models employ multiscale weighted colored subgraphs to describe crucial molecular and biomolecular interactions in terms of graph invariants derived from graph Laplacian, its pseudo-inverse, and adjacency matrices. Additionally, AGL-Score models are integrated with an advanced machine learning algorithm to predict biomolecular macroscopic properties from the low-dimensional graph representation of biomolecular structures. The proposed AGL-Score models are extensively validated for their scoring power, ranking power, docking power, and screening power via a number of benchmark datasets, namely CASF-2007, CASF-2013, and CASF-2016. Numerical results indicate that the proposed AGL-Score models are able to outperform other state-of-the-art scoring functions in protein-ligand binding scoring, ranking, docking, and screening. This study indicates that machine learning methods are powerful tools for molecular docking and virtual screening. It also indicates that spectral geometry or spectral graph theory has the ability to infer geometric properties.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A recently identified locus for coronary artery disease (CAD) tagged by rs8042271 is in a region of tight linkage disequilibrium (LD) between 2 genes (MFGE8, ABHD2) previously linked to atherosclerosis. Here we have explored the regulatory framework of this region to identify its functional relationship to CAD.
METHODS: The CAD Associated Region between MFGE8 and ABHD2 (CARMA) was investigated by bioinformatic approaches and transcriptional reporter assays to prioritize target genes and identify putative causal variants. Findings were integrated with publicly available gene expression datasets. MFGE8 silencing was performed in cell models relevant to CAD.
RESULTS: The regulatory potential of CARMA is disseminated sparsely over the entire region. CARMA contains multiple eQTL that regulate MFGE8 in coronary artery and coronary artery smooth muscle cell (CoSMC). SNPs that predict the expression of MFGE8 in artery are concordantly associated with higher risk of CAD (pval = 0.0014). Targeting CARMA by CRISPR/Cas9 in a cellular model increased MFGE8 expression. MFGE8 silencing was found to reduce CoSMC and monocyte (THP-1) but not endothelial cell proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a mechanistic link between a GWAS identified CAD risk locus and atherosclerosis. The intergenic locus CARMA regulates MFGE8 in a haplotype dependent manner. Individuals genetically susceptible to increased MFGE8 expression exhibit greater CAD risk. Suppressing MFGE8 expression reduced SMC and THP-1 proliferation. These data support an atherogenic contribution of CARMA/MFGE8 that may be linked to cell proliferation and/or improved survival of CAD relevant cell types.},

Recently, machine-learning scoring functions trained on protein-ligand complexes have shown great promise in small tailored studies. They have also raised controversy, specifically concerning model overfitting and applicability to novel targets. Here we provide a new ready-to-use scoring function (RF-Score-VS) trained on 15 426 active and 893 897 inactive molecules docked to a set of 102 targets. We use the full DUD-E data sets along with three docking tools, five classical and three machine-learning scoring functions for model building and performance assessment. Our results show RF-Score-VS can substantially improve virtual screening performance: RF-Score-VS top 1\% provides 55.6\% hit rate, whereas that of Vina only 16.2\% (for smaller percent the difference is even more encouraging: RF-Score-VS top 0.1\% achieves 88.6\% hit rate for 27.5\% using Vina). In addition, RF-Score-VS provides much better prediction of measured binding affinity than Vina (Pearson correlation of 0.56 and −0.18, respectively). Lastly, we test RF-Score-VS on an independent test set from the DEKOIS benchmark and observed comparable results. We provide full data sets to facilitate further research in this area (http://github.com/oddt/rfscorevs) as well as ready-to-use RF-Score-VS (http://github.com/oddt/rfscorevs\_binary).},

	abstract = {The family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) is one of the largest protein families in the human genome. GPCRs transduct chemical signals from extracellular to intracellular regions via a conformational switch between active and inactive states upon ligand binding. While experimental structures of GPCRs remain limited, high-accuracy computational predictions are now possible with AlphaFold2. However, AlphaFold2 only predicts one state and is biased toward either the active or inactive conformation depending on the GPCR class. Here, a multi-state prediction protocol is introduced that extends AlphaFold2 to predict either active or inactive states at very high accuracy using state-annotated templated GPCR databases. The predicted models accurately capture the main structural changes upon activation of the GPCR at the atomic level. For most of the benchmarked GPCRs (10 out of 15), models in the active and inactive states were closer to their corresponding activation state structures. Median RMSDs of the transmembrane regions were 1.12 Å and 1.41 Å for the active and inactive state models, respectively. The models were more suitable for protein-ligand docking than the original AlphaFold2 models and template-based models. Finally, our prediction protocol predicted accurate GPCR structures and GPCR-peptide complex structures in GPCR Dock 2021, a blind GPCR-ligand complex modeling competition. We expect that high accuracy GPCR models in both activation states will promote understanding in GPCR activation mechanisms and drug discovery for GPCRs. At the time, the new protocol paves the way towards capturing the dynamics of proteins at high-accuracy via machine-learning methods.},

In this interface, users can create text blocks to encapsulate writing and LLM prompts, model blocks for model parameter configurations, and connect these to create pipeline blocks that output generations.

While liver is the primary site of gene transcription for two pathways relevant to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), namely the complement system and cholesterol metabolism, we explored the contribution of AMD associated variants to modulate liver gene expression. We extracted publicly available data and computed the largest eQTL data set for liver tissue to date. Genotypes and expression data from all studies underwent rigorous quality control. Subsequently, Matrix eQTL was used to identify significant local eQTL. In total, liver samples from 588 individuals revealed 202,489 significant eQTL variants affecting 1,959 genes (Q-Value {\textless} 0.001). In addition, a further 101 independent eQTL signals were identified in 93 of the 1,959 eQTL genes.

Even though all three of these enzymes are required for cholesterol biosynthesis, only inhibition of the most upstream enzyme, EBP, led to cancer cell death via depletion of downstream sterols, an observation that was confirmed by genetic silencing of EBP. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic silencing of either DHCR7 or DHCR24 had no impact on cell viability. By using photoaffinity probes to generate a relationship between chemical structure and probe competition, we identified compounds that selectively inhibit either EBP or DHCR7.

Here, we used combinatorial RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping to generate a large genetic interaction map for 21 phenotypic features of Drosophila cells. We devised a method that combines genetic interactions on multiple phenotypes to reveal directional relationships. This network reconstructed the sequence of protein activities in mitosis.

	abstract = {Recommender systems provide users with personalized online product and service recommendations and are a ubiquitous part of today's online entertainment smorgasbord. However, many suffer from cold-start problems due to a lack of sufficient preference data, and this is hindering their development. Cross-domain recommender systems have been proposed as one possible solution. These systems transfer knowledge from one domain that has adequate preference information to another domain that does not. The outlook for cross-domain recommendation is promising, but existing methods cannot ensure the knowledge extracted from the source domain is consistent with the target domain, which may impact the accuracy of the recommendations. To address this challenging issue, we propose a cross-domain recommender system with consistent information transfer (CIT). Knowledge consistency is based on user and item latent groups, and domain adaptation techniques are used to map and adjust these groups in both domains to maintain consistency during the transfer learning process. Experiments were conducted on five real-world datasets in three categories: movies, books, and music. The results for nine cross-domain recommendation tasks show that CIT outperforms five benchmarks and increases the accuracy of recommendations in the target domain, especially with sparse data. Practically, our proposed method is applied into a telecom product recommender system and a business partner recommender system (Smart BizSeeker) to enhance personalized decision making for both businesses and individual customers.},

	abstract = {Mutations in ARID1A rank amongst the most common molecular aberrations in human cancer. However, oncogenic consequences of ARID1A mutation in human cells remain poorly defined due to lack of forward genetic models. Here, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ARID1A knockout in primary TP53-/- human gastric organoids induced morphologic dysplasia, tumorigenicity and mucinous differentiation. Genetic Wnt/B-catenin activation rescued mucinous differentiation, but not hyperproliferation, suggesting alternative pathways of ARID1A KO-mediated transformation. ARID1A mutation induced transcriptional regulatory modules characteristic of MSI and EBV subtype human gastric cancer, including FOXM1-associated mitotic genes and BIRC5/survivin. Convergently, high-throughput compound screening indicated selective vulnerability of ARID1A-deficient organoids to inhibition of BIRC5/survivin, functionally implicating this pathway as an essential mediator of ARID1A KO-dependent early-stage gastric tumorigenesis. Overall, we define distinct pathways downstream of oncogenic ARID1A mutation, with non-essential Wnt-inhibited mucinous differentiation in parallel with essential transcriptional FOXM1/BIRC5-stimulated proliferation, illustrating the general utility of organoid-based forward genetic cancer analysis in human cells.},

	abstract = {Cellular identity between generations of developing cells is propagated through the epigenome particularly via the accessible parts of the chromatin. It is now possible to measure chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution using single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq), which can reveal the regulatory variation behind the phenotypic variation. However, single-cell chromatin accessibility data are sparse, binary, and high dimensional, leading to unique computational challenges. To overcome these difficulties, we developed PRISM, a computational workflow that quantifies cell-to-cell chromatin accessibility variation while controlling for technical biases. PRISM is a novel multidimensional scaling-based method using angular cosine distance metrics coupled with distance from the spatial centroid. PRISM takes differences in accessibility at each genomic region between single cells into account. Using data generated in our lab and publicly available, we showed that PRISM outperforms an existing algorithm, which relies on the aggregate of signal across a set of genomic regions. PRISM showed robustness to noise in cells with low coverage for measuring chromatin accessibility. Our approach revealed the previously undetected accessibility variation where accessible sites differ between cells but the total number of accessible sites is constant. We also showed that PRISM, but not an existing algorithm, can find suppressed heterogeneity of accessibility at CTCF binding sites. Our updated approach uncovers new biological results with profound implications on the cellular heterogeneity of chromatin architecture.},

However, germ cell differentiation from human embryonic stem cells has been very inefficient so far. Even though the influence of various growth factors has been evaluated, the gene expression of different cell lines in relation to their differentiation potential has not yet been extensively examined. In this study, the potential of three male human embryonic stem cell lines to differentiate towards male gonadal cells was explored by analysing their gene expression profiles. The human embryonic stem cell lines were cultured for 14 days as monolayers on supporting human foreskin fibroblasts or as spheres in suspension, and were differentiated using BMP7, or spontaneous differentiation by omitting exogenous FGF2. TLDA analysis revealed that in the undifferentiated state, these cell lines have diverse mRNA profiles and exhibit significantly different potentials for differentiation towards the cell types present in the male gonads. This potential was associated with important factors directing the fate of the male primordial germ cells in vivo to form gonocytes, such as SOX17 or genes involved in the NODAL/ACTIVIN pathway, for example. Stimulation with BMP7 in suspension culture resulted in up-regulation of cytoplasmic SOX9 protein expression in all three lines. The observation that human embryonic stem cells differentiate towards germ and somatic cells after spontaneous and BMP7-induced stimulation in suspension emphasizes the important role of somatic cells in germ cell differentiation in vitro.},

Each line was defined by gene expression signatures and optimized for organoid culture according to niche factor requirements. In vitro and in xenografts, the organoids reproduced the histopathological grade and differentiation capacity of their parental tumors. Notably, we found that niche-independent growth is predominantly associated with the adenoma-carcinoma transition reflecting accumulation of multiple mutations. For matched pairs of primary and metastatic organoids, which had similar genetic profiles and niche factor requirements, the metastasis-derived organoids exhibited higher metastatic capacity. These observations underscore the importance of genotype-phenotype analyses at a single-patient level and the value of our resource to provide insights into colorectal tumorigenesis and patient-centered therapeutic development.},

We observed high inter-individual variability in the rates of change of cellular frequencies that was dictated by their baseline values, allowing identification of steady-state levels toward which a cell subset converged and the ordered convergence of multiple cell subsets toward an older adult homeostasis. These data form a high-dimensional trajectory of immune aging (IMM-AGE) that describes a person's immune status better than chronological age. We show that the IMM-AGE score predicted all-cause mortality beyond well-established risk factors in the Framingham Heart Study, establishing its potential use in clinics for identification of patients at risk.},

One approach is the development of “off-the-shelf” T-cell sources. Technologies to generate T-cells from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) may offer platforms to produce “off-the-shelf” and synthetic allogeneic T-cells. However, low differentiation efficiency and poor scalability of current methods may compromise their utilities. Here we show improved differentiation efficiency of T-cells from induced PSCs (iPSCs) derived from an antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell clone, or from T-cell receptor (TCR)-transduced iPSCs, as starting materials. We additionally describe feeder-free differentiation culture systems that span from iPSC maintenance to T-cell proliferation phases, enabling large-scale regenerated T-cell production. Moreover, simultaneous addition of SDF1α and a p38 inhibitor during T-cell differentiation enhances T-cell commitment. The regenerated T-cells show TCR-dependent functions in vitro and are capable of in vivo anti-tumor activity. This system provides a platform to generate a large number of regenerated T-cells for clinical application and investigate human T-cell differentiation and biology.},

While modeling the acute response to various anticancer agents in drug-sensitive human tumor cell lines, we consistently detected a small subpopulation of reversibly "drug-tolerant" cells. These cells demonstrate {\textgreater}100-fold reduced drug sensitivity and maintain viability via engagement of IGF-1 receptor signaling and an altered chromatin state that requires the histone demethylase RBP2/KDM5A/Jarid1A. This drug-tolerant phenotype is transiently acquired and relinquished at low frequency by individual cells within the population, implicating the dynamic regulation of phenotypic heterogeneity in drug tolerance. The drug-tolerant subpopulation can be selectively ablated by treatment with IGF-1 receptor inhibitors or chromatin-modifying agents, potentially yielding a therapeutic opportunity. Together, these findings suggest that cancer cell populations employ a dynamic survival strategy in which individual cells transiently assume a reversibly drug-tolerant state to protect the population from eradication by potentially lethal exposures.},

	abstract = {Cell therapy is witnessing a notable shift toward cell-free treatments based on paracrine factors, in particular, towards small extracellular vesicles (sEV), that mimic the functional effect of the parental cells. While numerous sEV-based applications are currently in advanced preclinical stages, their promised translation depends on overcoming the manufacturing hurdles posed by the large-scale production of purified sEV. Unquestionably, the culture medium used with the parental cells plays a key role in the sEV's secretion rate and content. An essential requisite is the use of a serum-, xeno-, and blood-free medium to meet the regulatory entity requirements of clinical-grade sEV's production. Here, we evaluated OxiumTMEXO, a regulatory complying medium, with respect to production capacity and conservation of the EV's characteristics and functionality and the parental cell's phenotype and viability. A comparative study was established with standard DMEM and a commercially available culture medium developed specifically for sEV production. Under similar conditions, OxiumTMEXO displayed a three-fold increase of sEV secretion, with an enrichment of particles ranging between 51 and 200 nm. These results were obtained through direct quantification from the conditioned medium to avoid the isolation method's interference and variability and were compared to the two culture media under evaluation. The higher yield obtained was consistent with several harvest time points (2, 4, and 6 days) and different cell sources, incluiding umbilical cord-, menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stromal cells and fibroblasts. Additionally, the stem cell phenotype and viability of the parental cell remained unchanged. Furthermore, OxiumTMEXO-sEV showed a similar expression pattern of the vesicular markers CD63, CD9, and CD81, with respect to sEV derived from the other conditions. The in vitro internalization assays in different target cell types and the pharmacokinetic profile of intraperitoneally administered sEV in vivo indicated that the higher EV production rate did not affect the uptake kinetics or the systemic biodistribution in healthy mice. In conclusion, the OxiumTMEXO medium sustains an efficient and robust production of large quantities of sEV, conserving the classic functional properties of internalization into acceptor target cells and biodistribution in vivo, supplying the amount and quality of EVs for the development of cell-free therapies.},

	abstract = {We aim to improve anti-ageing drug discovery, currently achieved through laborious and lengthy longevity analysis. Recent studies demonstrated that the most accurate molecular method to measure human age is based on CpG methylation profiles, as exemplified by several epigenetics clocks that can accurately predict an individual's age. Here, we developed CellAgeClock, a new epigenetic clock that measures subtle ageing changes in primary human cells in vitro . As such, it provides a unique tool to measure effects of relatively short pharmacological treatments on ageing. We validated the CellAgeClock against known longevity drugs such as rapamycin and trametinib. Moreover, we uncovered novel anti-ageing drugs, torin2 and Dactolisib (BEZ-235), demonstrating the value of our approach as a screening and discovery platform for anti-ageing strategies. The CellAgeClock outperforms other epigenetic clocks in measuring subtle ageing changes in primary human cells in culture. The tested drug treatments reduced senescence and other ageing markers, further consolidating our approach as a screening platform. Finally, we show that the novel anti-ageing drugs we uncovered in vitro , indeed increased longevity in vivo . Our method expands the scope of CpG methylation profiling from measuring human chronological and biological age from human samples in years, to accurately and rapidly detecting anti-ageing potential of drugs using human cells in vitro , providing a novel accelerated discovery platform to test sought after geroprotectors. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {While standard meta-analysis pools the results from randomized trials that compare two treatments, network meta-analysis aggregates the results of randomized trials comparing a wider variety of treatment options. However, it is unclear whether the aggregation of effect estimates across heterogeneous populations will be consistent for a meaningful parameter when not all treatments are evaluated on each population. Drawing from counterfactual theory and the causal inference framework, we define the population of interest in a network meta-analysis and define the target parameter under a series of nonparametric structural assumptions. This allows us to determine the requirements for identifiability of this parameter, enabling a description of the conditions under which network meta-analysis is appropriate and when it might mislead decision making. We then adapt several modeling strategies from the causal inference literature to obtain consistent estimation of the intervention-specific mean outcome and model-independent contrasts between treatments. Finally, we perform a reanalysis of a systematic review to compare the efficacy of antibiotics on suspected or confirmed methicillin-resistant {\textbackslash}textbackslashemph\{Staphylococcus aureus\} in hospitalized patients.},

As each experiment has a component of intrinsic variability, reporter gene expression is usually normalized with co-delivered genes that act as transfection controls. Recent reports in mammalian cells highlight how resource competition for gene expression leads to biases in data interpretation, with a direct impact on co-transfection experiments. Here we define the connection between resource competition and transient transfection experiments and discuss possible alternatives.

	abstract = {AbstractModel systems that recapitulate the complexity of human tumors and the reality of variable treatment responses are urgently needed to better understand cancer biology and to develop more effective cancer therapies. Here we report development and characterization of a large bank of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and matched organoid cultures from tumors that represent some of the greatest unmet needs in breast cancer research and treatment. These include endocrine-resistant, treatment-refractory, and metastatic breast cancers and, in some cases, multiple tumor collections from the same patients. The models can be grown long-term with high fidelity to the original tumors. We show that development of matched PDX and PDX-derived organoid (PDxO) models facilitates high-throughput drug screening that is feasible and cost-effective, while also allowing in vivo validation of results. Our data reveal consistency between drug screening results in organoids and drug responses in breast cancer PDX. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of using these patient-derived models for precision oncology in real time with patient care, using a case of a triple negative breast cancer with early metastatic recurrence as an example. Our results uncovered an FDA-approved drug with high efficacy against the models. Treatment with the PDxO-directed therapy resulted in a complete response for the patient and a progression-free survival period more than three times longer than her previous therapies. This work provides valuable new methods and resources for functional precision medicine and drug development for human breast cancer.Graphical Abstract},

Here we performed a comprehensive genomic analysis of 1,737 morphologically normal tissue biopsies of 9 organs from 5 donors. We found that somatic mutation accumulations and clonal expansions were widespread, although to variable extents, in morphologically normal human tissues. Somatic copy number alterations were rarely detected, except for in tissues from the oesophagus and cardia. Endogenous mutational processes with the SBS1 and SBS5 mutational signatures are ubiquitous among normal tissues, although they exhibit different relative activities. Exogenous mutational processes operate in multiple tissues from the same donor. We reconstructed the spatial somatic clonal architecture with sub-millimetre resolution. In the oesophagus and cardia, macroscopic somatic clones that expanded to hundreds of micrometres were frequently seen, whereas in tissues such as the colon, rectum and duodenum, somatic clones were microscopic in size and evolved independently, possibly restricted by local tissue microstructures. Our study depicts a body map of somatic mutations and clonal expansions from the same individual. Laser-capture microdissection and mini-bulk exome sequencing are combined to analyse somatic mutations in morphologically normal tissues from nine organs from five donors, revealing variation in mutation burdens, mutational signatures and clonal expansions.},

	abstract = {We address the problem of two-variable causal inference without intervention. This task is to infer an existing causal relation between two random variables, i.e., X \${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$ Y or Y \${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$ X , from purely observational data. As the option to modify a potential cause is not given in many situations, only structural properties of the data can be used to solve this ill-posed problem. We briefly review a number of state-of-the-art methods for this, including very recent ones. A novel inference method is introduced, Bayesian Causal Inference (BCI) which assumes a generative Bayesian hierarchical model to pursue the strategy of Bayesian model selection. In the adopted model, the distribution of the cause variable is given by a Poisson lognormal distribution, which allows to explicitly regard the discrete nature of datasets, correlations in the parameter spaces, as well as the variance of probability densities on logarithmic scales. We assume Fourier diagonal Field covariance operators. The model itself is restricted to use cases where a direct causal relation X \${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$ Y has to be decided against a relation Y \${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$ X , therefore we compare it other methods for this exact problem setting. The generative model assumed provides synthetic causal data for benchmarking our model in comparison to existing state-of-the-art models, namely LiNGAM, ANM-HSIC, ANM-MML, IGCI, and CGNN. We explore how well the above methods perform in case of high noise settings, strongly discretized data, and very sparse data. BCI performs generally reliably with synthetic data as well as with the real world TCEP benchmark set, with an accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms. We discuss directions for the future development of BCI.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTIn studies evaluating the accuracy of diagnostic tests, three designs are commonly used, crossover, randomized, and noncomparative. Existing methods for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests mainly consider the simple cases in which the reference test in all or none of the studies can be considered a gold standard test, and in which all studies use either a randomized or noncomparative design. The proliferation of diagnostic instruments and the diversity of study designs create a need for more general methods to combine studies that include or do not include a gold standard test and that use various designs. This article extends the Bayesian hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model to network meta-analysis of diagnostic tests to simultaneously compare multiple tests within a missing data framework. The method accounts for correlations between multiple tests and for heterogeneity between studies. It also allows different studies to include different subsets of diagnostic tests and provides flexibility in the choice of summary statistics. The model is evaluated using simulations and illustrated using real data on tests for deep vein thrombosis, with sensitivity analyses. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

We engineered 3D epithelia cultures using a kidney epithelia cell line (MDCK) and spherical polymer scaffolds. These kidney epithelia were characterized by live microscopy, immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. Strikingly, the epithelial cells displayed increased physiological relevance; they were extensively polarized and developed a more differentiated phenotype. Using such a growth system allows for direct transmission and fluorescence imaging with few restrictions using wide-field, confocal and Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy. We also assessed the wider relevance of this 3D culturing technique with several epithelial cell lines. Finally, we established that these 3D micro-tissues can be used for infection as well as biochemical assays and to study important cellular processes such as epithelial mesenchymal transmission. This new biomimetic model could provide a broadly applicable 3D culture system to study epithelia and epithelia related disorders.},

Here, we combine sewer network and demographic data to identify a residential catchment for sampling, and explore the potential of applying untargeted genomics and metabolomics to sewage to collect actionable public health data. We find that wastewater sampled upstream in a residential catchment is representative of the human microbiome and metabolome, and we are able to identify glucuronidated compounds indicative of direct human excretion, which are typically degraded too quickly to be detected at treatment plants. We show that diurnal variations during 24-hour sampling can be leveraged to discriminate between biomarkers in sewage that are associated with human activity from those related to the environmental background. Finally, we putatively annotate a suite of human-associated metabolites, including pharmaceuticals, food metabolites, and biomarkers of human health and activity, suggesting that mining untargeted data derived from residential sewage can expand currently-used biomarkers with direct public health or policy relevance.},

We previously demonstrated that 5'-adenosine monophosphate (5'-AMP), a ribonucleic acid nucleotide, produces reversible deep hypothermia in rats when the ambient temperature is appropriately controlled. Thus, we hypothesized that 5'-AMP-induced hypothermia (AIH) may attenuate brain ischemia/reperfusion injury. Transient cerebral ischemia was induced by using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats. Rats that underwent AIH treatment exhibited a significant reduction in neutrophil elastase infiltration into neuronal cells and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), and Toll-like receptor (TLR) protein expression in the infarcted area compared to euthermic controls. AIH treatment also decreased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling- (TUNEL-) positive neuronal cells. The overall infarct volume was significantly smaller in AIH-treated rats, and neurological function was improved. By contrast, rats with ischemic brain injury that were administered 5'-AMP without inducing hypothermia had ischemia/reperfusion injuries similar to those in euthermic controls. Thus, the neuroprotective effects of AIH were primarily related to hypothermia.},

	abstract = {Aberrant activation of the Wnt signalling pathway is required for tumour initiation and survival in the majority of colorectal cancers. The development of inhibitors of Wnt signalling has been the focus of multiple drug discovery programs targeting colorectal cancer and other malignancies associated with aberrant pathway activation. However, progression of new clinical entities targeting the Wnt pathway has been slow. One challenge lies with the limited predictive power of 2D cancer cell lines because they fail to fully recapitulate intratumoural phenotypic heterogeneity. In particular, the relationship between 2D cancer cell biology and cancer stem cell function is poorly understood. By contrast, 3D tumour organoids provide a platform in which complex cell-cell interactions can be studied. However, complex 3D models provide a challenging platform for the quantitative analysis of drug responses of therapies that have differential effects on tumour cell subpopulations. Here, we generated tumour organoids from colorectal cancer patients and tested their responses to inhibitors of Tankyrase (TNKSi) which are known to modulate Wnt signalling. Using compounds with 3 orders of magnitude difference in cellular mechanistic potency together with image-based assays, we demonstrate that morphometric analyses can capture subtle alterations in organoid responses to Wnt inhibitors that are consistent with activity against a cancer stem cell subpopulation. Overall our study highlights the value of phenotypic readouts as a quantitative method to asses drug-induced effects in a relevant preclinical model.},

	abstract = {Web-crawled datasets have enabled remarkable generalization capabilities in recent image-text models such as CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image pre-training) or Flamingo, but little is known about the dataset creation processes. In this work, we introduce a testbed of six publicly available data sources—YFCC, LAION, Conceptual Captions, WIT, RedCaps, Shutterstock—to investigate how pre-training distributions induce robustness in CLIP. We ﬁnd that the performance of the pretraining data varies substantially across distribution shifts, with no single data source dominating. Moreover, we systematically study the interactions between these data sources and ﬁnd that combining multiple sources does not necessarily yield better models, but rather dilutes the robustness of the best individual data source. We complement our empirical ﬁndings with theoretical insights from a simple setting, where combining the training data also results in diluted robustness. In addition, our theoretical model provides a candidate explanation for the success of the CLIP-based data ﬁltering technique recently employed in the LAION dataset. Overall our results demonstrate that simply gathering a large amount of data from the web is not the most effective way to build a pre-training dataset for robust generalization, necessitating further study into dataset design.

	abstract = {Three billion years of evolution has produced a tremendous diversity of protein molecules1, but the full potential of proteins is likely to be much greater. Accessing this potential has been challenging for both computation and experiments because the space of possible protein molecules is much larger than the space of those likely to have functions. Here we introduce Chroma, a generative model for proteins and protein complexes that can directly sample novel protein structures and sequences, and that can be conditioned to steer the generative process towards desired properties and functions. To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process that respects the conformational statistics of polymer ensembles, an efficient neural architecture for molecular systems that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic scaling, layers for efficiently synthesizing three-dimensional structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion models. Chroma achieves protein design as Bayesian inference under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, semantics and even natural-language prompts. The experimental characterization of 310 proteins shows that sampling from Chroma results in proteins that are highly expressed, fold and have favourable biophysical properties. The crystal structures of two designed proteins exhibit atomistic agreement with Chroma samples (a backbone root-mean-square deviation of around 1.0 Å). With this unified approach to protein design, we hope to accelerate the programming of protein matter to benefit human health, materials science and synthetic biology.},

	abstract = {Background: We address the problem of selecting and assessing classification and regression models using cross-validation. Current state-of-the-art methods can yield models with high variance, rendering them unsuitable for a number of practical applications including QSAR. In this paper we describe and evaluate best practices which improve reliability and increase confidence in selected models. A key operational component of the proposed methods is cloud computing which enables routine use of previously infeasible approaches.
Methods: We describe in detail an algorithm for repeated grid-search V-fold cross-validation for parameter tuning in classification and regression, and we define a repeated nested cross-validation algorithm for model assessment. As regards variable selection and parameter tuning we define two algorithms (repeated grid-search cross-validation and double cross-validation), and provide arguments for using the repeated grid-search in the general case.
Results: We show results of our algorithms on seven QSAR datasets. The variation of the prediction performance, which is the result of choosing different splits of the dataset in V-fold cross-validation, needs to be taken into account when selecting and assessing classification and regression models.
Conclusions: We demonstrate the importance of repeating cross-validation when selecting an optimal model, as well as the importance of repeating nested cross-validation when assessing a prediction error.},

Cell division is tightly regulated by multiple evolutionarily conserved cell cycle control mechanisms, to ensure the production of two genetically identical cells. Cell cycle checkpoints operate as DNA surveillance mechanisms that prevent the accumulation and propagation of genetic errors during cell division. Checkpoints can delay cell cycle progression or, in response to irreparable DNA damage, induce cell cycle exit or cell death. Cancer-associated mutations that perturb cell cycle control allow continuous cell division chiefly by compromising the ability of cells to exit the cell cycle. Continuous rounds of division, however, create increased reliance on other cell cycle control mechanisms to prevent catastrophic levels of damage and maintain cell viability. New detailed insights into cell cycle control mechanisms and their role in cancer reveal how these dependencies can be best exploited in cancer treatment.},

Lipids function as essential building blocks for membranes, serve as fuel to drive energy-demanding processes and play a key role as signaling molecules and as regulators of numerous cellular functions. Not unexpectedly, cancer cells, as well as other cell types in the tumor microenvironment, exploit various ways to acquire lipids and extensively rewire their metabolism as part of a plastic and context-dependent metabolic reprogramming that is driven by both oncogenic and environmental cues. The resulting changes in the fate and composition of lipids help cancer cells to thrive in a changing microenvironment by supporting key oncogenic functions and cancer hallmarks, including cellular energetics, promoting feedforward oncogenic signaling, resisting oxidative and other stresses, regulating intercellular communication and immune responses. Supported by the close connection between altered lipid metabolism and the pathogenic process, specific lipid profiles are emerging as unique disease biomarkers, with diagnostic, prognostic and predictive potential. Multiple preclinical studies illustrate the translational promise of exploiting lipid metabolism in cancer, and critically, have shown context dependent actionable vulnerabilities that can be rationally targeted, particularly in combinatorial approaches. Moreover, lipids themselves can be used as membrane disrupting agents or as key components of nanocarriers of various therapeutics. With a number of preclinical compounds and strategies that are approaching clinical trials, we are at the doorstep of exploiting a hitherto underappreciated hallmark of cancer and promising target in the oncologist's strategy to combat cancer.},

Fatty acids, cholesterol, and phospholipid are the three most prevalent lipids that act as energy producers, signaling molecules, and source material for the biogenesis of cell membranes. The enhanced synthesis, storage, and uptake of lipids contribute to cancer progression. The rewiring of lipid metabolism in cancer has been linked to the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways and cross talk with the tumor microenvironment. The resulting activity favors the survival and proliferation of tumor cells in the harsh conditions within the tumor. Lipid metabolism also plays a vital role in tumor immunogenicity via effects on the function of the noncancer cells within the tumor microenvironment, especially immune‐associated cells. Targeting altered lipid metabolism pathways has shown potential as a promising anticancer therapy. Here, we review recent evidence implicating the contribution of lipid metabolic reprogramming in cancer to cancer progression, and discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism rewiring in cancer, and potential therapeutic strategies directed toward lipid metabolism in cancer. This review sheds new light to fully understanding of the role of lipid metabolic reprogramming in the context of cancer and provides valuable clues on therapeutic strategies targeting lipid metabolism in cancer., Lipid metabolic reprogramming‐mediated crosstalk between cancer cells and tumor microenvironment contributes to cancer progression. Stromal cells, such as adipocyte, CAF, epithelia cells contribute to lipid metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. Cancer cells undergo lipid metabolism rewiring to generate building materials for membrane, lipid second messenger and energy supply. Cancer cells can also secret lipid metabolites to affect immune cell functions, creating a tumor‐favoring immune microenvironment.},

Detailed genomic and biochemical analyses reveal that PRDM10 functions as a sequence-specific transcription factor. We identify Eif3b, which encodes a core component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, as a key downstream target, and demonstrate that growth inhibition in PRDM10-deficient mESCs is in part mediated through EIF3B-dependent effects on global translation.

This has been studied for decades but has not yielded consistent results, probably due to perturbations induced by the synchronisation methods used in most previous studies. To avoid this problem, we have developed a system to analyse unperturbed exponentially growing populations of fission yeast cells. We generated thousands of fixed single-cell measurements of cell size, cell cycle stage and the levels of global cellular translation and transcription. We show that translation scales with size, and additionally, increases at late S-phase/early G2 and early in mitosis and decreases later in mitosis, suggesting that cell cycle controls are also operative over global cellular translation. Transcription increases with both size and the amount of DNA, suggesting that the level of transcription of a cell may be the result of a dynamic equilibrium between the number of RNA polymerases associating and disassociating from DNA.},

	abstract = {This study deals with neural networks in the sense of geometric transformations acting on the coordinate representation of the underlying data manifold which the data is sampled from. It forms part of an attempt to construct a formalized general theory of neural networks in the setting of Riemannian geometry. From this perspective, the following theoretical results are developed and proven for feedforward networks. First it is shown that residual neural networks are finite difference approximations to dynamical systems of first order differential equations, as opposed to ordinary networks that are static. This implies that the network is learning systems of differential equations governing the coordinate transformations that represent the data. Second it is shown that a closed form solution of the metric tensor on the underlying data manifold can be found by backpropagating the coordinate representations learned by the neural network itself. This is formulated in a formal abstract sense as a sequence of Lie group actions on the metric fibre space in the principal and associated bundles on the data manifold. Toy experiments were run to confirm parts of the proposed theory, as well as to provide intuitions as to how neural networks operate on data.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07818},
	abstract = {An increasingly common viewpoint is that protein dynamics data sets reside in a non-linear subspace of low conformational energy. Ideal data analysis tools for such data sets should therefore account for such non-linear geometry. The Riemannian geometry setting can be suitable for a variety of reasons. First, it comes with a rich structure to account for a wide range of geometries that can be modelled after an energy landscape. Second, many standard data analysis tools initially developed for data in Euclidean space can also be generalised to data on a Riemannian manifold. In the context of protein dynamics, a conceptual challenge comes from the lack of a suitable smooth manifold and the lack of guidelines for constructing a smooth Riemannian structure based on an energy landscape. In addition, computational feasibility in computing geodesics and related mappings poses a major challenge. This work considers these challenges. The first part of the paper develops a novel local approximation technique for computing geodesics and related mappings on Riemannian manifolds in a computationally feasible manner. The second part constructs a smooth manifold of point clouds modulo rigid body group actions and a Riemannian structure that is based on an energy landscape for protein conformations. The resulting Riemannian geometry is tested on several data analysis tasks relevant for protein dynamics data. It performs exceptionally well on coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulated data. In particular, the geodesics with given start- and end-points approximately recover corresponding molecular dynamics trajectories for proteins that undergo relatively ordered transitions with medium sized deformations. The Riemannian protein geometry also gives physically realistic summary statistics and retrieves the underlying dimension even for large-sized deformations within seconds on a laptop.},

	abstract = {Significance
            High-dimensional datasets are becoming increasingly prevalent in many scientific fields. A universal theme connecting these high-dimensional datasets is the ansatz that data points are constrained to lie on nonlinear low-dimensional manifolds, whose structure is dictated by the natural laws governing the data. While tools have been developed for estimating global properties of these data manifolds, estimating the Riemannian curvature, a local property, has not been considered. Computing curvature of data manifolds offers both detailed criteria with which to evaluate models of these complex data (e.g., a Klein bottle model of image patches) and a way to explore detailed geometric features that cannot simply be visualized by the naked eye (e.g., in single-cell RNA-sequencing data).
          , 
            Most high-dimensional datasets are thought to be inherently low-dimensional—that is, data points are constrained to lie on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space. Here, we study the viability of two approaches from differential geometry to estimate the Riemannian curvature of these low-dimensional manifolds. The intrinsic approach relates curvature to the Laplace–Beltrami operator using the heat-trace expansion and is agnostic to how a manifold is embedded in a high-dimensional space. The extrinsic approach relates the ambient coordinates of a manifold’s embedding to its curvature using the Second Fundamental Form and the Gauss–Codazzi equation. We found that the intrinsic approach fails to accurately estimate the curvature of even a two-dimensional constant-curvature manifold, whereas the extrinsic approach was able to handle more complex toy models, even when confounded by practical constraints like small sample sizes and measurement noise. To test the applicability of the extrinsic approach to real-world data, we computed the curvature of a well-studied manifold of image patches and recapitulated its topological classification as a Klein bottle. Lastly, we applied the extrinsic approach to study single-cell transcriptomic sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets of blood, gastrulation, and brain cells to quantify the Riemannian curvature of scRNAseq manifolds.},

We use multiple published atlas-scale datasets, genetic perturbation screens and direct experimental validation to show that Scriabin accurately recovers expected cell–cell communication edges and identifies communication networks that can be obscured by agglomerative methods. Additionally, we use spatial transcriptomic data to show that Scriabin can uncover spatial features of interaction from dissociated data alone. Finally, we demonstrate applications to longitudinal datasets to follow communication pathways operating between timepoints.

Particularly, increased matrix stiffness has profound effects on tumor growth and metastasis. While endothelial cells are key players in cancer progression, the influence of tumor stiffness on the endothelium and the impact on metastasis is unknown. Through quantitative mass spectrometry, we find that the matricellular protein CCN1/CYR61 is highly regulated by stiffness in endothelial cells. We show that stiffness-induced CCN1 activates ?-catenin nuclear translocation and signaling and that this contributes to upregulate N-cadherin levels on the surface of the endothelium, in vitro. This facilitates N-cadherin-dependent cancer cell?endothelium interaction. Using intravital imaging, we show that knockout of Ccn1 in endothelial cells inhibits melanoma cancer cell binding to the blood vessels, a critical step in cancer cell transit through the vasculature to metastasize. Targeting stiffness-induced changes in the vasculature, such as CCN1, is therefore a potential yet unappreciated mechanism to impair metastasis.},

A detailed examination of highly invasive ovarian cancer cells (HEY A8) relative to their less invasive parental cells (HEY), demonstrates that deformability is also an accurate biomarker of metastatic potential. Comparative gene expression analyses indicate that the reduced stiffness of highly metastatic HEY A8 cells is associated with actin cytoskeleton remodeling and microscopic examination of actin fiber structure in these cell lines is consistent with this prediction. Our results indicate that cell stiffness may be a useful biomarker to evaluate the relative metastatic potential of ovarian and perhaps other types of cancer cells.},

Recent clinical evidence demonstrating a link between TGFβ signaling and cancer progression is fostering interest in this signaling pathway as a therapeutic target. Anti-TGFβ therapies are currently being developed and tested in pre-clinical studies. However, targeting TGFβ carries a substantial risk as this pathway is implicated in multiple homeostatic processes and is also known to have tumor-suppressor functions. Additionally, clinical and experimental results show that TGFβ has diverse and often conflicting roles in tumor progression even within the same tumor types.

Here, we identified a subpopulation of phenotypic plastic colon cancer cells: EpCAMlo cells are motile, invasive, chemo-resistant, and highly metastatic. EpCAMlo bulk and single-cell RNAseq analysis indicated 1. enhanced Wnt/-catenin signaling, 2. a broad spectrum of degrees of EMT activation including hybrid E/M states (partial EMT) with highly plastic features, and 3. high correlation with the CMS4 subtype, accounting for colon cancer cases with poor prognosis and a pronounced stromal component. Of note, a signature of genes specifically expressed in EpCAMlo cancer cells is highly predictive of overall survival in tumors other than CMS4, thus highlighting the relevance of quasi-mesenchymal tumor cells across the spectrum of colon cancers.},

After determining that ICAM1 has the ability to efficiently mediate antibody internalization, we constructed two ICAM1 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) by conjugating ICAM1 antibodies to different cytotoxic payloads through cleavable chemical linkers. The efficacies of two ICAM1 ADCs have been evaluated in comparison with the first-line chemodrug Gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo, and ICAM1 antibodies coupled with warhead DX-8951 derivative (DXd) or monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) elicit a potent and consistent tumor attenuation.

In this study, we generated mouse models harboring different combinations of key colorectal cancer driver mutations (Apc, Kras, Tgfbr2, Trp53, Fbxw7) in intestinal epithelial cells to comprehensively investigate their roles in the development of primary tumors and metastases. ApcΔ716 mutation caused intestinal adenomas and combination with Trp53R270H mutation or Tgfbr2 deletion induced submucosal invasion. The addition of KrasG12D mutation yielded epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like morphology and lymph vessel intravasation of the invasive tumors. In contrast, combinations of ApcΔ716 with KrasG12D and Fbxw7 mutation were insufficient for submucosal invasion, but still induced EMT-like histology. Studies using tumor-derived organoids showed that KrasG12D was critical for liver metastasis following splenic transplantation, when this mutation was combined with either ApcΔ716 plus Trp53R270H or Tgfbr2 deletion, with the highest incidence of metastasis displayed by tumors with a ApcΔ716 KrasG12D Tgfbr2−/− genotype. RNA sequencing analysis of tumor organoids defined distinct gene expression profiles characteristic for the respective combinations of driver mutations, with upregulated genes in ApcΔ716 KrasG12D Tgfbr2−/− tumors found to be similarly upregulated in specimens of human metastatic colorectal cancer. Our results show how activation of Wnt and Kras with suppression of TGFβ signaling in intestinal epithelial cells is sufficient for colorectal cancer metastasis, with possible implications for the development of metastasis prevention strategies.Significance: These findings illuminate how key driver mutations in colon cancer cooperate to drive the development of metastatic disease, with potential implications for the development of suitable prevention strategies.

	abstract = {K-ras mutations are found in 40–50\% of human colorectal adenomas and carcinomas, but their functional contribution remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that a conditional mutant K-ras mouse model (K-rasAsp12/Cre), with transient intestinal Cre activation by β-Naphthoflavone (β-NF) treatment, displayed transgene recombination and K-rasAsp12 expression in the murine intestines, but developed few intestinal adenomas over 2 years. However, when crossed with ApcMin/+ mice, the K-rasAsp12/Cre/ApcMin/+ offspring showed acceleration of intestinal tumourigenesis with significantly changed average lifespan (P {\textless} 0.05) decreased to 18.4 ± 5.4 weeks from 20.9 ± 4.7 weeks (control ApcMin/+ mice). The numbers of adenomas in the small intestine and large intestine were significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) increased by 1.5-fold and 5.7-fold, respectively, in K-rasAsp12/Cre/ApcMin/+ mice compared with ApcMin/+ mice, with the more marked increase in adenoma prevalence in the large intestine. To explore possible mechanisms for K-rasAsp12 and ApcMin co-operation, the Mitogen-activated protein kinase (Mapk), Akt and Wnt signalling pathways, including selected target gene expression levels, were evaluated in normal large intestine and large intestinal tumours. K-rasAsp12 increased activation of Mapk and Akt signalling pathway targets phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pErk) and pAkt, and increased relative expression levels of Wnt pathway targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), gastrin, cyclo-oxygenase 2 (Cox2) and T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1) in K-rasAsp12/Cre/ApcMin/+ adenomas compared with that of ApcMin/+ adenomas, although other Wnt signalling pathway target genes such as Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARd), matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), protein phosphatase 1 alpha (PP1A) and c-myc remained unchanged. In conclusion, intestinal expression of K-rasAsp12 promotes mutant Apc-initiated intestinal adenoma formation in vivo more in the large intestine than the small intestine, with evidence of synergistic co-operation between mutant K-ras and Apc involving increased expression of some Wnt-pathway target genes.},

              translation is an emerging feature of cancer cells. Oncogenic transformation in colorectal cancer (CRC) is driven by mutations in

              further enhanced global translation efficiency and was associated with a lower 4E-BP1-to-eIF4E ratio. Quadruple mutant cells with additional P53 loss displayed the highest global translational capacity, paralleled by high proliferation and growth rates, indicating that the proteome is heavily geared toward cell division. Transcriptional reprogramming facilitating global translation included elevated ribogenesis and activation of mTORC1 signaling. Accordingly, interfering with the mTORC1/4E-BP/eIF4E axis inhibited the growth potential endowed by accumulation of multiple drivers. In conclusion, the ACS is characterized by a strongly altered global translational landscape in epithelial cells, exposing a therapeutic potential for direct targeting of the translational apparatus.},

The Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) protein is an IDP that plays a key role in Wnt signaling and mutations in Apc initiate cancer. APC forms droplets via its 20R domains and self-association domain (ASAD) and in the context of Axin. However, the mechanism involved is unknown. Here, we used peptides to study the molecular mechanism and regulation of APC droplet formation. We found that a peptide derived from the ASAD of APC-formed droplets. Peptide array screening showed that the ASAD bound other APC peptides corresponding to the 20R3 and 20R5 domains. We discovered that the 20R3/5 peptides also formed droplets by themselves and mapped specific residues within 20R3/5 that are necessary for droplet formation. When incubated together, the ASAD and 20R3/5 did not form droplets. Thus, the interaction of the ASAD with 20R3 and 20R5 may regulate the droplet formation as a means of regulating different cellular functions. Phosphorylation of 20R3 or 20R5 at specific residues prevented droplet formation of 20R3/5. Our results reveal that phosphorylation and the ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, which are both important properties of intrinsically disordered proteins, are related to each other in APC. Phosphorylation inhibited the liquid-liquid phase separation of APC, acting as an 'on-off' switch for droplet formation. Phosphorylation may thus be a common mechanism regulating LLPS in intrinsically disordered proteins.},

APC-MCR was susceptible to proteolysis, lacked α-helical secondary structure and did not display thermal unfolding transition. It displayed an extended conformation in size exclusion chromatography and was accessible for phosphorylation by CK1ε in vitro. The length of disordered regions in APC increases with species complexity, from C. elegans to H. sapiens.

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common causes of death, despite decades of research. Initially considered as a disease due to genetic mutations, it is now viewed as a complex malignancy because of the involvement of epigenetic abnormalities. A functional equivalence between genetic and epigenetic mechanisms has been suggested in CRC initiation and progression. A hallmark of CRC is its pathogenetic heterogeneity attained through at least three distinct pathways: a traditional (adenoma-carcinoma sequence), an alternative, and more recently the so-called serrated pathway. While the alternative pathway is more heterogeneous and less characterized, the traditional and serrated pathways appear to be more homogeneous and clearly distinct. One unsolved question in colon cancer biology concerns the cells of origin and from which crypt compartment the different pathways originate. Based on molecular and pathological evidences, we propose that the traditional and serrated pathways originate from different crypt compartments explaining their genetic/epigenetic and clinicopathological differences. In this paper, we will discuss the current knowledge of CRC pathogenesis and, specifically, summarize the role of genetic/epigenetic changes in the origin and progression of the multiple CRC pathways. Elucidation of the link between the molecular and clinico-pathological aspects of CRC would improve our understanding of its etiology and impact both prevention and treatment.},

We looked for four genetic alterations (ras-gene mutations and allelic deletions of chromosomes 5, 17, and 18) in 172 colorectal-tumor specimens representing various stages of neoplastic development. The specimens consisted of 40 predominantly early-stage adenomas from 7 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, 40 adenomas (19 without associated foci of carcinoma and 21 with such foci) from 33 patients without familial polyposis, and 92 carcinomas resected from 89 patients. We found that ras-gene mutations occurred in 58 percent of adenomas larger than 1 cm and in 47 percent of carcinomas. However, ras mutations were found in only 9 percent of adenomas under 1 cm in size. Sequences on chromosome 5 that are linked to the gene for familial adenomatous polyposis were not lost in adenomas from the patients with polyposis but were lost in 29 to 35 percent of adenomas and carcinomas, respectively, from other patients. A specific region of chromosome 18 was deleted frequently in carcinomas (73 percent) and in advanced adenomas (47 percent) but only occasionally in earlier-stage adenomas (11 to 13 percent). Chromosome 17p sequences were usually lost only in carcinomas (75 percent). The four molecular alterations accumulated in a fashion that paralleled the clinical progression of tumors. These results are consistent with a model of colorectal tumorigenesis in which the steps required for the development of cancer often involve the mutational activation of an oncogene coupled with the loss of several genes that normally suppress tumorigenesis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), characterised by widespread promoter methylation, is associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer. The independent effect of CIMP, MSI and BRAF mutation on prognosis remains uncertain.
METHODS: Utilising 649 colon cancers (stage I-IV) in two independent cohort studies, we quantified DNA methylation in eight CIMP-specific promoters (CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3 and SOCS1) as well as CHFR, HIC1, IGFBP3, MGMT, MINT1, MINT31, p14, and WRN by using MethyLight technology. We examined MSI, KRAS and BRAF status. Cox proportional hazard models computed hazard ratios (HRs) for colon cancer-specific and overall mortalities, adjusting for patient characteristics and tumoral molecular features.
RESULTS: After adjustment for other predictors of patient survival, patients with CIMP-high cancers (126 (19\%) tumours with {\textgreater}or=6/8 methylated CIMP-specific promoters) experienced a significantly low colon cancer-specific mortality (multivariate HR 0.44, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.88), whereas the BRAF mutation was significantly associated with a high cancer-specific mortality (multivariate HR 1.97, 95\% CI 1.13 to 3.42). A trend toward a low cancer-specific mortality was observed for MSI-high tumours (multivariate HR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.36 to 1.37). In stratified analyses, CIMP-high tumours were associated with a significant reduction in colon cancer-specific mortality, regardless of both MSI and BRAF status. The relation between CIMP-high and lower mortality appeared to be consistent across all stages. KRAS mutation was unrelated to prognostic significance.
CONCLUSION: CIMP-high appears to be an independent predictor of a low colon cancer-specific mortality, while BRAF mutation is associated with a high colon cancer-specific mortality.},

	abstract = {Conventional adenomas are initiated by APC gene mutation that activates the WNT signal. Serrated neoplasia is commonly initiated by BRAF or KRAS mutation. WNT pathway activation may also occur, however, to what extent this is owing to APC mutation is unknown. We examined aberrant nuclear β-catenin immunolocalization as a surrogate for WNT pathway activation and analyzed the entire APC gene coding sequence in serrated and conventional pathway polyps and cancers. WNT pathway activation was a common event in conventional pathway lesions with aberrant nuclear immunolocalization of β-catenin and truncating APC mutations in 90\% and 89\% of conventional adenomas and 82\% and 70\% of BRAF wild-type cancers, respectively. WNT pathway activation was seen to a lesser extent in serrated pathway lesions. It occurred at the transition to dysplasia in serrated polyps with a significant increase in nuclear β-catenin labeling from sessile serrated adenomas (10\%) to sessile serrated adenomas with dysplasia (55\%) and traditional serrated adenomas (9\%) to traditional serrated adenomas with dysplasia (39\%) (P=0.0001). However, unlike the conventional pathway, truncating APC mutations were rare in the serrated pathway lesions especially sessile serrated adenomas even when dysplastic (15\%) and in the BRAF mutant cancers with microsatellite instability that arise from them (8\%). In contrast, APC missense mutations that were rare in conventional pathway adenomas and cancers (3\% in BRAF wild-type cancers) were more frequent in BRAF mutant cancers with microsatellite instability (32\%). We conclude that increased WNT signaling is important in the transition to malignancy in the serrated pathway but that APC mutation is less common and the spectrum of mutations is different than in conventional colorectal carcinogenesis. Moderate impact APC mutations and non-APC-related causes of increased WNT signaling may have a more important role in serrated neoplasia than the truncating APC mutations common in conventional adenomas.},

The evidence supporting this hypothesis has increased rapidly in recent years and the purpose of this article is to review this evidence critically and highlight its clinical significance.
METHODS: Medline searches were used to identify recent key articles relating to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Further pertinent articles were obtained by manual scanning of the reference lists of identified papers.
RESULTS: The evidence supporting the adenoma-carcinoma sequence can be classified as epidemiological, clinicopathological and genetic. The most recent and largest body of data relates to molecular genetic events and their cellular effects; however, many other approaches, such as cytogenetics, molecular cytogenetics and cytometry, have also yielded valuable information.
CONCLUSION: Recent work continues to support the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, but there is a paucity of data on the interrelationship between different genetic mutations and on the relationship between molecular and other types of genetic abnormalities. The clinical utility of the observations described has yet to be fully realized and global genetic analysis of colorectal tumours may prove to be central in rational adenoma management.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with the BRAF V600E mutation have a poor prognosis, with a median overall survival of 4 to 6 months after failure of initial therapy. Inhibition of BRAF alone has limited activity because of pathway reactivation through epidermal growth factor receptor signaling.
METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we enrolled 665 patients with BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer who had had disease progression after one or two previous regimens. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab (triplet-therapy group); encorafenib and cetuximab (doublet-therapy group); or the investigators' choice of either cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab and FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan) (control group). The primary end points were overall survival and objective response rate in the triplet-therapy group as compared with the control group. A secondary end point was overall survival in the doublet-therapy group as compared with the control group. We report here the results of a prespecified interim analysis.
RESULTS: The median overall survival was 9.0 months in the triplet-therapy group and 5.4 months in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.52; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.70; P{\textless}0.001). The confirmed response rate was 26\% (95\% CI, 18 to 35) in the triplet-therapy group and 2\% (95\% CI, 0 to 7) in the control group (P{\textless}0.001). The median overall survival in the doublet-therapy group was 8.4 months (hazard ratio for death vs. control, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.45 to 0.79; P{\textless}0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 58\% of patients in the triplet-therapy group, in 50\% in the doublet-therapy group, and in 61\% in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: A combination of encorafenib, cetuximab, and binimetinib resulted in significantly longer overall survival and a higher response rate than standard therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with the BRAF V600E mutation.

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies in Western countries. Over the last 20 years, and the last decade in particular, the clinical outcome for patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) has improved greatly due not only to an increase in the number of patients being referred for and undergoing surgical resection of their localised metastatic disease but also to a more strategic approach to the delivery of systemic therapy and an expansion in the use of ablative techniques. This reflects the increase in the number of patients that are being managed within a multidisciplinary team environment and specialist cancer centres, and the emergence over the same time period not only of improved imaging techniques but also prognostic and predictive molecular markers. Treatment decisions for patients with mCRC must be evidence-based. Thus, these ESMO consensus guidelines have been developed based on the current available evidence to provide a series of evidence-based recommendations to assist in the treatment and management of patients with mCRC in this rapidly evolving treatment setting.},

	abstract = {Open-source software development has skyrocketed in part due to community tools like github.com, which allows publication of code as well as the ability to create branches and push accepted modifications back to the original repository. As the number and size of EM-based datasets increases, the connectomics community faces similar issues when we publish snapshot data corresponding to a publication. Ideally, there would be a mechanism where remote collaborators could modify branches of the data and then flexibly reintegrate results via moderated acceptance of changes. The DVID system provides a web-based connectomics API and the first steps toward such a distributed versioning approach to EM-based connectomics datasets. Through its use as the central data resource for Janelia's FlyEM team, we have integrated the concepts of distributed versioning into reconstruction workflows, allowing support for proofreader training and segmentation experiments through branched, versioned data. DVID also supports persistence to a variety of storage systems from high-speed local SSDs to cloud-based object stores, which allows its deployment on laptops as well as large servers. The tailoring of the backend storage to each type of connectomics data leads to efficient storage and fast queries. DVID is freely available as open-source software with an increasing number of supported storage options.},

In this study, we examine the extent to which the AlphaFold database has structurally illuminated this ‘dark matter’ of the natural protein universe at high predicted accuracy. We further describe the protein diversity that these models cover as an annotated interactive sequence similarity network, accessible at https://uniprot3d.org/atlas/AFDB90v4. By searching for novelties from sequence, structure and semantic perspectives, we uncovered the β-flower fold, added several protein families to Pfam database2 and experimentally demonstrated that one of these belongs to a new superfamily of translation-targeting toxin–antitoxin systems, TumE–TumA. This work underscores the value of large-scale efforts in identifying, annotating and prioritizing new protein families. By leveraging the recent deep learning revolution in protein bioinformatics, we can now shed light into uncharted areas of the protein universe at an unprecedented scale, paving the way to innovations in life sciences and biotechnology.},

The overexpression of the HER family has been recognized as one of the most common cellular dysregulation associated with a wide variety of tumor types. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a new and promising class of anticancer therapeutics that combine the cancer specificity of antibodies with cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs. Two HER2-directed ADCs, trastuzumane-emtansine (T-DM1) and trastuzumab-deruxtecan (DS-8201a), have been approved for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013 and 2019, respectively. A third HER2-directed ADC, disitamab vedotin (RC48), has been approved for locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer by the NMPA (National Medical Products Administration) of China in 2021. A total of 11 ADCs that target HER family receptors (EGFR, HER2 or HER3) are currently under clinical trials. In this review article, we summarize the three approved ADCs (T-DM1, DS-8201a and RC48), together with the investigational EGFR-directed ADCs (ABT-414, MRG003 and M1231), HER2-directed ADCs (SYD985, ARX-788, A166, MRG002, ALT-P7, GQ1001 and SBT6050) and HER3-directed ADC (U3-1402). Lastly, we discuss the major challenges associated with the development of ADCs, and highlight the possible future directions to tackle these challenges.},

Currently, such information is manually curated from the literature, obtained from high-throughput microscopy-based screens and predicted from primary sequence. To get a comprehensive view of the localization of a protein, it is thus necessary to consult multiple databases and prediction tools. To address this, we present the COMPARTMENTS resource, which integrates all sources listed above as well as the results of automatic text mining. The resource is automatically kept up to date with source databases, and all localization evidence is mapped onto common protein identifiers and Gene Ontology terms. We further assign confidence scores to the localization evidence to facilitate comparison of different types and sources of evidence. To further improve the comparability, we assign confidence scores based on the type and source of the localization evidence. Finally, we visualize the unified localization evidence for a protein on a schematic cell to provide a simple overview.Database URL:http://compartments.jensenlab.org},

These variants survived the founding bottleneck rather than being distributed over a large number of ultrarare variants. Although this effect is well established in Mendelian genetics, its value in common disease genetics is less explored1,2. FinnGen aims to study the genome and national health register data of 500,000 Finnish individuals. Given the relatively high median age of participants (63 years) and the substantial fraction of hospital-based recruitment, FinnGen is enriched for disease end points. Here we analyse data from 224,737 participants from FinnGen and study 15 diseases that have previously been investigated in large genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We also include meta-analyses of biobank data from Estonia and the United Kingdom. We identified 30 new associations, primarily low-frequency variants, enriched in the Finnish population. A GWAS of 1,932 diseases also identified 2,733 genome-wide significant associations (893 phenome-wide significant (PWS), P {\textless} 2.6 × 10–11) at 2,496 (771 PWS) independent loci with 807 (247 PWS) end points. Among these, fine-mapping implicated 148 (73 PWS) coding variants associated with 83 (42 PWS) end points. Moreover, 91 (47 PWS) had an allele frequency of {\textless}5\% in non-Finnish European individuals, of which 62 (32 PWS) were enriched by more than twofold in Finland. These findings demonstrate the power of bottlenecked populations to find entry points into the biology of common diseases through low-frequency, high impact variants.},

	abstract = {A polygenic score (PGS) or polygenic risk score (PRS) is an estimate of an individual’s genetic liability to a trait or disease, calculated according to their genotype profile and relevant genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. While present PRSs typically explain only a small fraction of trait variance, their correlation with the single largest contributor to phenotypic variation—genetic liability—has led to the routine application of PRSs across biomedical research. Among a range of applications, PRSs are exploited to assess shared etiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the clinical utility of genetic data for complex disease and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed that compare outcomes (e.g., gene expression and cellular response to treatment) between individuals with low and high PRS values. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRSs become more powerful, PRSs are set to play a key role in research and stratified medicine. However, despite the importance and growing application of PRSs, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here, we provide detailed guidelines for performing and interpreting PRS analyses. We outline standard quality control steps, discuss different methods for the calculation of PRSs, provide an introductory online tutorial, highlight common misconceptions relating to PRS results, offer recommendations for best practice and discuss future challenges.},

Through extensive simulations, external validations, and analysis of 65 traits, we demonstrate that PUMAS can perform various model-tuning procedures using GWAS summary statistics and effectively benchmark and optimize PRS models under diverse genetic architecture.

	abstract = {Deep learning is accelerating drug discovery. However, current approaches are often affected by limitations in the available data, e.g., in terms of size or molecular diversity. Active learning is poised to be a solution for drug discovery in low-data regimes. In active learning, a model is updated iteratively by taking multiple smaller screening steps, instead of suggesting many molecules at once with a single model for traditional ‘one-shot’ screening. This iterative approach aims to improve models during the screening process and can adjust course along the way. Despite pioneering applications, it is currently unclear how active learning holds up to traditional approaches and what the best strategies are for prospective drug discovery applications. In this study, we combine six active learning strategies with two distinct deep learning methods and analyse their performance on three large-scale libraries. For each strategy, we investigate its capacity to discover bioactive hits and explore the chemical space. We found that active learning can achieve up to a six-fold improvement in hit retrieval compared to traditional methods in a low-data scenario. The strategy to acquire new molecules at each cycle resulted to be the primary driver of performance, and it determined the ‘molecular journey’ throughout screening cycles. Finally, we show that active learning can quickly compensate for a lack of molecular diversity in the starting set. These results advocate for the adoption of active deep learning to accelerate drug discovery in low-data regimes.},

Here, high-density immunophenotyping of AML coupled with proteogenomics identified unique expression of a variety of antigens, including the RNA helicase U5 snRNP200, on the surface of AML cells but not on normal hematopoietic precursors and skewed Fc receptor distribution in the AML immune microenvironment. Cell membrane localization of U5 snRNP200 was linked to surface expression of the Fcγ receptor IIIA (FcγIIIA, also known as CD32A) and correlated with expression of interferon-regulated immune response genes. Anti-U5 snRNP200 antibodies engaging activating Fcγ receptors were efficacious across immunocompetent AML models and were augmented by combination with azacitidine. These data provide a roadmap of AML-associated antigens with Fc receptor distribution in AML and highlight the potential for targeting the AML cell surface using Fc-optimized therapeutics.},

To address this issue, we introduce Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE), a novel line notation for chemical structures. SAFE reimagines SMILES strings as an unordered sequence of interconnected fragment blocks while maintaining full compatibility with existing SMILES parsers. It streamlines complex generative tasks, including scaffold decoration, fragment linking, polymer generation, and scaffold hopping, while facilitating autoregressive generation for fragment-constrained design, thereby eliminating the need for intricate decoding or graph-based models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFE by training an 87-million-parameter GPT2-like model on a dataset containing 1.1 billion SAFE representations. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our SAFE-GPT model exhibits versatile and robust optimization performance. SAFE opens up new avenues for the rapid exploration of chemical space under various constraints, promising breakthroughs in AI-driven molecular design.},

This complexity leads to brittle architectures, where seemingly minor changes can significantly reduce training speed, or render models untrainable. In this work, we ask to what extent the standard transformer block can be simplified? Combining signal propagation theory and empirical observations, we motivate modifications that allow many block components to be removed with no loss of training speed, including skip connections, projection or value parameters, sequential sub-blocks and normalisation layers. In experiments on both autoregressive decoder-only and BERT encoder-only models, our simplified transformers emulate the per-update training speed and performance of standard transformers, while enjoying 15\% faster training throughput, and using 15\% fewer parameters.},

To incorporate the inherent structure of the data and account for the fact that not all support patterns are equally likely, this model was enriched by enforcing various structural sparsity patterns. One plausible such extension of classic sparse coding, instigated by the emergence of graph signal processing, is graph regularized sparse coding. This model explicitly considers the intrinsic geometrical structure of the data domain, and has been successfully employed in various applications. However, emphasis was given to developing algorithmic solutions, and to date, the theoretical foundations to this problem have been lagging behind. In this work, we fill this gap and present a novel theoretical analysis of the graph regularized sparse coding problem, providing worst-case guarantees for the stability of the obtained solution, as well as for the success of several pursuit techniques. Furthermore, we formulate the conditions for which the superiority of the graph regularized sparse coding solution over the structure-agnostic sparse coding counterpart is established.},

However, the molecular determinants of such interactions have been challenging to understand, even as genomic, proteomic, and structural data grows. This knowledge gap has been a major obstacle for the comprehensive understanding of cellular protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and for the de novo design of protein binders that are crucial for synthetic biology and translational applications. We exploit a geometric deep learning framework operating on protein surfaces that generates fingerprints to describe geometric and chemical features critical to drive PPIs. We hypothesized these fingerprints capture the key aspects of molecular recognition that represent a new paradigm in the computational design of novel protein interactions. As a proof-of-principle, we computationally designed several de novo protein binders to engage four protein targets: SARS-CoV-2 spike, PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4. Several designs were experimentally optimized while others were purely generated in silico, reaching nanomolar affinity with structural and mutational characterization showing highly accurate predictions. Overall, our surface-centric approach captures the physical and chemical determinants of molecular recognition, enabling a novel approach for the de novo design of protein interactions and, more broadly, of artificial proteins with function.},

Here, we report a series of designed structured protein linkers incorporating naturally occurring protein domains and compare their properties to commonly used Gly4Ser repeat linkers. When incorporated into the hinge region of an immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecule, flexible Gly4Ser repeats did not result in detectable extensions of the IgG antigen-binding domains, in contrast to linkers including more rigid domains such as β2-microglobulin, Zn-α2-glycoprotein and tetratricopeptide repeats. This study adds an additional set of linkers with varying lengths and rigidities to the available linker repertoire, which may be useful for the construction of antibodies with enhanced binding properties or other fusion proteins.},

A long-standing design approach uses genetic fusion to join protein homo-oligomer subunits via α-helical linkers to form more complex symmetric assemblies, but this method is hampered by linker flexibility and a dearth of geometric solutions. Here, we describe a general computational method for rigidly fusing homo-oligomer and spacer building blocks to generate user-defined architectures that generates far more geometric solutions than previous approaches. The fusion junctions are then optimized using Rosetta to minimize flexibility. We apply this method to design and test 92 dihedral symmetric protein assemblies using a set of designed homodimers and repeat protein building blocks. Experimental validation by native mass spectrometry, small-angle X-ray scattering, and negative-stain single-particle electron microscopy confirms the assembly states for 11 designs. Most of these assemblies are constructed from designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), held in place on one end by α-helical fusion and on the other by a designed homodimer interface, and we explored their use for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure determination by incorporating DARPin variants selected to bind targets of interest. Although the target resolution was limited by preferred orientation effects and small scaffold size, we found that the dual anchoring strategy reduced the flexibility of the target-DARPIN complex with respect to the overall assembly, suggesting that multipoint anchoring of binding domains could contribute to cryo-EM structure determination of small proteins.},

Here we describe a method of connecting two proteins via a ‘fusion α helix’ formed by joining two pre-existing helices into a single extended helix. Because simple ligation of two helices does not guarantee the formation of a continuous helix, we used EY-CBS, a synthetic cross linker that has been shown to react selectively with cysteines in α-helices, to stabilize the connecting helix. Formation and stabilization of the fusion helix was confirmed by determining the crystal structures of the fusion proteins with and without bound EY-CBS. Our method should be widely applicable for linking protein building blocks to generate predictable structures.},

	abstract = {The design of cell-targeted protein therapeutics can be informed by natural protein–protein interactions that use cooperative physical contacts to achieve cell type specificity. Here we applied this approach in vivo to the anemia drug erythropoietin (EPO), to direct its activity to EPO receptors (EPO-Rs) on red blood cell (RBC) precursors and prevent interaction with EPO-Rs on nonerythroid cells, such as platelets. Our engineered EPO molecule was mutated to weaken its affinity for EPO-R, but its avidity for RBC precursors was rescued via tethering to an antibody fragment that specifically binds the human RBC marker glycophorin A (huGYPA). We systematically tested the impact of these engineering steps on in vivo markers of efficacy, side effects, and pharmacokinetics. huGYPA transgenic mice dosed with targeted EPO exhibited elevated RBC levels, with only minimal platelet effects. This in vivo selectivity depended on the weakening EPO mutation, fusion to the RBC-specific antibody, and expression of huGYPA. The terminal plasma half-life of targeted EPO was ∼28.3 h in transgenic mice vs. ∼15.5 h in nontransgenic mice, indicating that huGYPA on mature RBCs acted as a significant drug sink but did not inhibit efficacy. In a therapeutic context, our targeting approach may allow higher restorative doses of EPO without platelet-mediated side effects, and also may improve drug pharmacokinetics. These results demonstrate how rational drug design can improve in vivo specificity, with potential application to diverse protein therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Nanobodies can be seen as next-generation tools for the recognition and modulation of antigens that are inaccessible to conventional antibodies. Due to their compact structure and high stability, nanobodies see frequent usage in basic research, and their chemical functionalization opens the way towards promising diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In this Review, central aspects of nanobody functionalization are presented, together with selected applications. While early conjugation strategies relied on the random modification of natural amino acids, more recent studies have focused on the site-specific attachment of functional moieties. Such techniques include chemoenzymatic approaches, expressed protein ligation, and amber suppression in combination with bioorthogonal modification strategies. Recent applications range from sophisticated imaging and mass spectrometry to the delivery of nanobodies into living cells for the visualization and manipulation of intracellular antigens.},

	abstract = {Chemically induced proximity (CIP) is a powerful tool to study cellular functions. However with current CIP inducers it is difficult to directly modulate unligandable and endogenous targets, and therapeutic translational potential is also restricted. Herein, we combine CIP and chemical nanobody engineering and create cell-permeable small molecule-nanobody conjugate inducers of proximity (SNACIPs). The SNACIP inducer cRGT carrying a cyclic cell-penetrating peptide rapidly enters live cells and dimerizes eDHFR and GFP-variants. cRGT enables minute-scale, reversible, no-wash and dose-dependent control of cellular processes including signaling cascade, cargo transport and ferroptosis. Small-molecule motifs can also be installed via post-translational modifications. Therefore, latent-type SNACIPs including cRTC are designed that are functionally assembled inside living cells. cRTC contains a nanobody against an intrinsically disordered protein TPX2, a microtubule nucleation factor overexpressed in various cancers. Cancer cell proliferation is inhibited and tumor growth is suppressed in vivo. Hence, SNACIPs are valuable proximity inducers for regulating cellular functions.},

One formulation of the problem is to identify molecules that simultaneously exhibit strong binding affinity for a target protein, minimal off-target interactions, and suitable pharmacokinetic properties. Inspired by prior work that uses active learning to accelerate the identification of strong binders, we implement multi-objective Bayesian optimization to reduce the computational cost of multi-property virtual screening and apply it to the identification of ligands predicted to be selective based on docking scores to on- and off-targets. We demonstrate the superiority of Pareto optimization over scalarization across three case studies. Further, we use the developed optimization tool to search a virtual library of over 4M molecules for those predicted to be selective dual inhibitors of EGFR and IGF1R, acquiring 100\% of the molecules that form the library's Pareto front after exploring only 8\% of the library. This workflow and associated open source software can reduce the screening burden of molecular design projects and is complementary to research aiming to improve the accuracy of binding predictions and other molecular properties.},

Here we develop an AI system that can predict the fully flexible all-atom structure of protein-ligand complexes directly, given a multiple sequence alignment representation of the protein and a SMILES string representing the ligand. At a high accuracy threshold, unseen protein-ligand complexes can be predicted more accurately than for RoseTTAFold-AA, and at medium accuracy even classical docking methods that use known protein structures as input are surpassed. The high accuracy presented here suggests that the goal of AI-based drug discovery is one step closer, but there is still a way to go to fully grasp the complexity of protein-ligand interactions.

	abstract = {Rich data and powerful machine learning models allow us to design drugs for a specific protein target in silico. Recently, the inclusion of 3D structures during targeted drug design shows superior performance to other target-free models as the atomic interaction in the 3D space is explicitly modeled. However, current 3D target-aware models either rely on the voxelized atom densities or the autoregressive sampling process, which are not equivariant to rotation or easily violate geometric constraints resulting in unrealistic structures. In this work, we develop a 3D equivariant diffusion model to solve the above challenges. To achieve target-aware molecule design, our method learns a joint generative process of both continuous atom coordinates and categorical atom types with a SE(3)-equivariant network. Moreover, we show that our model can serve as an unsupervised feature extractor to estimate the binding affinity under proper parameterization, which provides an effective way for drug screening. To evaluate our model, we propose a comprehensive framework to evaluate the quality of sampled molecules from different dimensions. Empirical studies show our model could generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures and better affinities towards the protein targets, and improve binding affinity ranking and prediction without retraining.},

Graph generation is a crucial computational task on graphs with numerous real-world applications. It aims to learn the distribution of given graphs and then generate new graphs. Given the great success of diffusion models in image generation, increasing efforts have been made to leverage these techniques to advance graph generation in recent years. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive overview of generative diffusion models on graphs, In particular, we review representative algorithms for three variants of graph diffusion models, i.e., Score Matching with Langevin Dynamics (SMLD), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), and Score-based Generative Model (SGM). Then, we summarize the major applications of generative diffusion models on graphs with a specific focus on molecule and protein modeling. Finally, we discuss promising directions in generative diffusion models on graph-structured data.

However, current methods of model evaluation are overly optimistic in measuring generalization to new targets, and there does not exist a standard data set of sufficient size to compare performance between models. We present a new data set for structure-based machine learning, the CrossDocked2020 set, with 22.5 million poses of ligands docked into multiple similar binding pockets across the Protein Data Bank, and perform a comprehensive evaluation of grid-based convolutional neural network (CNN) models on this data set. We also demonstrate how the partitioning of the training data and test data can impact the results of models trained with the PDBbind data set, how performance improves by adding more lower-quality training data, and how training with docked poses imparts pose sensitivity to the predicted affinity of a complex. Our best performing model, an ensemble of five densely connected CNNs, achieves a root mean squared error of 1.42 and Pearson R of 0.612 on the affinity prediction task, an AUC of 0.956 at binding pose classification, and a 68.4\% accuracy at pose selection on the CrossDocked2020 set. By providing data splits for clustered cross-validation and the raw data for the CrossDocked2020 set, we establish the first standardized data set for training machine learning models to recognize ligands in noncognate target structures while also greatly expanding the number of poses available for training. In order to facilitate community adoption of this data set for benchmarking protein–ligand binding affinity prediction, we provide our models, weights, and the CrossDocked2020 set at https://github.com/gnina/models.},

This makes the diversity of proposed candidates a key consideration in the ideation phase. In this work, we propose an active learning algorithm leveraging epistemic uncertainty estimation and the recently proposed GFlowNets as a generator of diverse candidate solutions, with the objective to obtain a diverse batch of useful (as defined by some utility function, for example, the predicted anti-microbial activity of a peptide) and informative candidates after each round. We also propose a scheme to incorporate existing labeled datasets of candidates, in addition to a reward function, to speed up learning in GFlowNets.

	abstract = {We present a new way of extending independent components analysis (ICA) to overcomplete representations. In contrast to the causal generative extensions of ICA which maintain marginal independence of sources, we deﬁne features as deterministic (linear) functions of the inputs. This assumption results in marginal dependencies among the features, but conditional independence of the features given the inputs. By assigning energies to the features a probability distribution over the input states is deﬁned through the Boltzmann distribution. Free parameters of this model are trained using the contrastive divergence objective (Hinton, 2002). When the number of features is equal to the number of input dimensions this energy-based model reduces to noiseless ICA and we show experimentally that the proposed learning algorithm is able to perform blind source separation on speech data. In additional experiments we train overcomplete energy-based models to extract features from various standard data-sets containing speech, natural images, hand-written digits and faces.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effects of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling in unsupervised Maximum Likelihood (ML) learning. Our attention is restricted to the family of unnormalized probability densities for which the negative log density (or energy function) is a ConvNet. We find that many of the techniques used to stabilize training in previous studies are not necessary. ML learning with a ConvNet potential requires only a few hyper-parameters and no regularization. Using this minimal framework, we identify a variety of ML learning outcomes that depend solely on the implementation of MCMC sampling.On one hand, we show that it is easy to train an energy-based model which can sample realistic images with short-run Langevin. ML can be effective and stable even when MCMC samples have much higher energy than true steady-state samples throughout training. Based on this insight, we introduce an ML method with purely noise-initialized MCMC, high-quality short-run synthesis, and the same budget as ML with informative MCMC initialization such as CD or PCD. Unlike previous models, our energy model can obtain realistic high-diversity samples from a noise signal after training.On the other hand, ConvNet potentials learned with non-convergent MCMC do not have a valid steady-state and cannot be considered approximate unnormalized densities of the training data because long-run MCMC samples differ greatly from observed images. We show that it is much harder to train a ConvNet potential to learn a steady-state over realistic images. To our knowledge, long-run MCMC samples of all previous models lose the realism of short-run samples. With correct tuning of Langevin noise, we train the first ConvNet potentials for which long-run and steady-state MCMC samples are realistic images.},

In this paper, a review was made of methods for estimation of thermodynamic properties of biomass, including standard enthalpy of combustion hC⁰, enthalpy of formation hf⁰, entropy s⁰, and Gibbs free energy of formation gf⁰. These parameters were calculated on molar and mass speciﬁc basis for 32 microorganism species, including 14 bacteria, 7 yeast and 11 algae species. It was found that hf⁰, s⁰, gf⁰ are, respectively, similar for all the analyzed species, due to the fact that all living organisms have a common ancestor and thus a similar chemical composition. Furthermore, all the analyzed microorganisms have negative hf⁰, originating from partial oxidation of all other elements by oxygen and nitrogen. A brief review was given of microorganism endogenous and growth metabolic rates. Finally, based on the determined thermodynamic properties, entropy of individual E. coli and Pseudomonas cells were determined and entropy of a Pseudomonas colony during its lifespan was calculated and analyzed. Three periods can be distinguished in the existence of a microorganism colony: (a) accumulation period when cell number, mass and entropy increase, (b) steady state period when they are approximately constant, and (c) decumulation period when they decrease.},

We show that activation of each sensor is orthogonal to the other sensors, and to other common inducible systems. We demonstrate independent control of three fluorescent proteins in a single cell, chemically defining eight unique transcriptional states. To demonstrate biosensor utility in metabolic engineering, we apply the glucarate biosensor to monitor product formation in a heterologous glucarate biosynthesis pathway and identify superior enzyme variants.

            Building up to melanoma
            
              Numerous cancer-causing mutations have been identified over the years, but they do not occur in isolation and it is difficult to disentangle the effects of individual genetic changes in a tumor that contains hundreds of mutations. To gain insight into melanoma biology and facilitate further study of this cancer, Hodis
              et al
              . began with healthy human melanocytes and sequentially introduced melanoma-associated mutations using gene editing. The edited cells were then grown in mouse models, simulating human melanomas with different mutation patterns. The authors examined the genomics, histology, and biological behavior of the resulting tumors and compared them with naturally occurring human tumors, demonstrating the relevance of their approach. —YN

              INTRODUCTION
              Cancer develops from cells that become malignant because of mutations in multiple genes—often accumulated over long time periods—that produce a phenotypic diversity across patient tumors. Specific genetic alterations in particular cancer types have been linked to prognosis, to response or resistance to therapies (especially targeted therapeutics), and to a tumor’s propensity to acquire further mutations, among other phenotypes. However, genotype-phenotype connections are challenging to infer in patients, as any two tumors differ genetically in too many ways to isolate the effect of one or several mutations. The ability to systematically connect cancer-associated mutations or combinations thereof with their phenotypic consequences would advance our understanding of the mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis and genetically linked disease features.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              We reasoned that genome editing and the fitness advantage of cancer-associated mutations could be leveraged to generate human cellular models of tumor development. Such genome-edited models would replicate the precise genetics, lineage relationships, and stepwise progression of cancer and allow us to establish genotype-to-phenotype links in a controlled experimental design. While similar models have been realized for tumors originating from self-renewing stem cells as cells of origin, specifically in colorectal cancer, no comparable models exist for tumor types that arise from nonstem differentiated cells. We present an approach that starts from the nonstem cell of origin of melanoma, the healthy human melanocyte; this approach then generates a series of cells with precise genome editing of mutations in key cancer genes, thus expanding the horizon of possible cellular models of cancer development.
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                We generated a progressive series of genome-edited human models of melanoma. We started from healthy human melanocytes and introduced, in a stepwise fashion, mutations in up to five genes spanning six pathways commonly dysregulated in melanoma:
                CDKN2A
                (part of the RB pathway),
                BRAF
                (MAPK),
                TERT
                (telomerase),
                PTEN
                (PI3K/AKT),
                TP53
                (p53), and
                APC
                (Wnt), for a total of nine genetically distinct cellular models. We characterized these models during growth in vitro and after intradermal injection through mouse xenografts, using physiological assessment, histopathology, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), leveraging computational methods and machine learning algorithms. Through these models, we connected melanocyte genotypes to phenotypes such as gene expression programs, replicative immortality, malignancy, rapid tumor growth, tumor pigmentation, metastasis, and histopathological features. In
                
                vitro, consecutive mutations produced an ordered progression through expression space. In
                
                vivo, mutations in malignant cells also affected the cell-type composition and expression states of tumor-infiltrating microenvironment cells. Our melanoma models shared genotype-associated expression programs with patient melanomas and partially recapitulated patient melanoma genotype-associated histopathological features.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              The genotype-phenotype connections we identify highlight how the impact of mutations often depends on genetic context. Such genetic epistasis makes understanding the phenotypic consequences of the mutational landscape of human cancers a combinatorial problem whose study requires modeling strategies that can scale to multiple mutations, such as the one presented in this study. Genome-edited human models of cancer enable the identification of causal relationships between defined sets of genetic alterations and disease-relevant phenotypes, furthering understanding of how cancer mutations help give rise to the diverse and varied phenotypes of human malignancy.
              
                
                  Genome-engineered human cell models connect melanoma genotypes to phenotypes.
                  Sequential, precise gene editing of human melanocytes produced a series of melanoma models. The editing approach we developed—without selection markers or single-cell cloning—is applicable to other cell types, expanding the toolkit of available cancer models. Through in-depth phenotypic characterization of in vitro cells and in vivo tumors from xenografts in immunodeficient mice, multimutant melanoma genotypes were causally linked to specific phenotypes.},

            Tumors acquire alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in an adaptive walk through the fitness landscape of tumorigenesis. However, the interactions between oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that shape this landscape remain poorly resolved and cannot be revealed by human cancer genomics alone. Here, we use a multiplexed, autochthonous mouse platform to model and quantify the initiation and growth of more than one hundred genotypes of lung tumors across four oncogenic contexts: KRAS G12D, KRAS G12C, BRAF V600E, and EGFR L858R. We show that the fitness landscape is rugged—the effect of tumor suppressor inactivation often switches between beneficial and deleterious depending on the oncogenic context—and shows no evidence of diminishing-returns epistasis within variants of the same oncogene. These findings argue against a simple linear signaling relationship amongst these three oncogenes and imply a critical role for off-axis signaling in determining the fitness effects of inactivating tumor suppressors.},

Here, we shed light on how the sequential acquisition of genomic alterations generates oncogene-negative lung tumors. We couple tumor barcoding with combinatorial and multiplexed somatic genome editing to characterize the fitness landscapes of three tumor suppressor genes NF1, RASA1, and PTEN, the inactivation of which jointly drives oncogene-negative lung adenocarcinoma initiation and growth. The fitness landscape was surprisingly accessible, with each additional mutation leading to growth advantage. Furthermore, the fitness landscapes remained fully accessible across backgrounds with the inactivation of additional tumor suppressor genes. These results suggest that while predicting cancer evolution will be challenging, acquiring the multiple alterations that drive the growth of oncogene-negative tumors can be facilitated by the lack of constraints on mutational order.},

To determine whether Apc disruption is required for tumor maintenance, we developed a mouse model of CRC whereby Apc can be conditionally suppressed using a doxycycline-regulated shRNA. Apc suppression produces adenomas in both the small intestine and colon that, in the presence of Kras and p53 mutations, can progress to invasive carcinoma. In established tumors, Apc restoration drives rapid and widespread tumor-cell differentiation and sustained regression without relapse. Tumor regression is accompanied by the reestablishment of normal crypt-villus homeostasis, such that once aberrantly proliferating cells reacquire self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capability. Our study reveals that CRC cells can revert to functioning normal cells given appropriate signals and provide compelling in vivo validation of the Wnt pathway as a therapeutic target for treatment of CRC.},

We also observe changes in nutrient and energy sensing pathways, including reduced serum IGF-1, increased AMPK activity, and decreased AKT, TOR, and S6K activities.

            Many new cancer drugs fail at the clinical stage owing to poor efficacy and/or excessive toxicity, though whether this reflects shortcomings of the target or the drug is often unclear. To gain earlier insights into factors that can influence the therapeutic index of target inhibition in vivo, we combine inducible RNA interference and somatic engineering technologies to produce a cost-effective platform that enables systemic and inducible suppression of candidate target in normal tissues and tumor cells in the same mouse. By comparing the consequences of genetic and pharmacological CDK9 inhibition, we establish the utility of this platform to predict factors influencing the therapeutic index. Additionally, our studies provide support, and some cautionary notes, for the clinical development of CDK9 inhibitors.

To address this issue, we established a versatile preclinical platform in which genetically defined cancers are produced using somatic tissue engineering in transgenic mice harboring a doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA against the target of interest. In this system, target inhibition is achieved by the addition of doxycycline, enabling simultaneous assessment of efficacy and toxicity in the same animal. As proof of concept, we focused on CDK9—a cancer target whose clinical development has been hampered by compounds with poorly understood target specificity and unacceptable toxicities. We systematically compared phenotypes produced by genetic
              Cdk9
              inhibition to those achieved using a recently developed highly specific small molecule CDK9 inhibitor and found that both perturbations led to robust antitumor responses. Remarkably, nontoxic levels of CDK9 inhibition could achieve significant treatment efficacy, and dose-dependent toxicities produced by prolonged CDK9 suppression were largely reversible upon
              Cdk9
              restoration or drug withdrawal. Overall, these results establish a versatile in vivo target validation platform that can be employed for rapid triaging of therapeutic targets and lend support to efforts aimed at advancing CDK9 inhibitors for cancer therapy.},

It has gradually become clear that many tumors harbor CSCs in dedicated niches, and yet their identification and eradication has not been as obvious as was initially hoped. Recently developed lineage-tracing and cell-ablation strategies have provided insights into CSC plasticity, quiescence, renewal, and therapeutic response. Here we discuss new developments in the CSC field in relationship to changing insights into how normal stem cells maintain healthy tissues. Expectations in the field have become more realistic, and now, the first successes of therapies based on the CSC concept are emerging.},

Ipafricept (OMP-54F28) is a first-in-class recombinant fusion protein with the extracellular part of human frizzled 8 receptor fused to a human IgG1 Fc fragment that binds Wnt ligands. This trial evaluated ipafricept in patients with solid tumors.Experimental design: A 3+3 design was used; ipafricept was given intravenously every 3 weeks. The objectives were determination of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy.Results: 26 patients were treated in seven dose-escalation cohorts (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg). No further dose escalation was pursued as PK modeling indicated that the target efficacious dose was reached at 10 mg/kg, and fragility fractures occurred at 20 mg/kg. Most common related grade 1 and 2 adverse events (AEs; ≥20\% of patients) were dysgeusia, decreased appetite, fatigue, and muscle spasms. Ipafricept-related grade 3 TEAEs included hypophosphatemia and weight decrease (1 subject each, 3.8\%). Ipafricept half-life was ∼4 days and had low incidence of antidrug antibody formation (7.69\%) with no impact on drug exposure. Six patients had β-C-terminal telopeptide (β-CTX) doubling from baseline, which was reversible. PD modulation of Wnt pathway genes in hair follicles occurred ≥2.5 mg/kg. Two desmoid tumor and a germ cell cancer patient experienced stable disease for {\textgreater}6 months.Conclusions: Ipafricept was well tolerated, with RP2D of 15 mg/kg Q3W.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

We prioritized likely causal variants using functionally informed fine-mapping, yielding 42 associations with less than five variants in the 95\% credible set. Similarity-based clustering suggested roles for early developmental processes, cell cycle signaling and vascular cell migration and proliferation in the pathogenesis of CAD. We prioritized 220 candidate causal genes, combining eight complementary approaches, including 123 supported by three or more approaches. Using CRISPR–Cas9, we experimentally validated the effect of an enhancer in MYO9B, which appears to mediate CAD risk by regulating vascular cell motility. Our analysis identifies and systematically characterizes {\textgreater}250 risk loci for CAD to inform experimental interrogation of putative causal mechanisms for CAD.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of premature death and disability worldwide, with both genetic and environmental determinants. While genome-wide association studies have identified multiple genetic loci associated with cardiovascular diseases, exact genes driving these associations remain mostly uncovered. Due to Finland’s population history, many deleterious and high-impact variants are enriched in the Finnish population giving a possibility to find genetic associations for protein-truncating variants that likely tie the association to a gene and that would not be detected elsewhere. In a large Finnish biobank study FinnGen, we identified an association between an inframe insertion rs534125149 in MFGE8 (encoding lactadherin) and protection against coronary atherosclerosis. This variant is highly enriched in Finland, and the protective association was replicated in meta-analysis of BioBank Japan and Estonian biobank. Additionally, we identified a protective association between splice acceptor variant rs201988637 in MFGE8 and coronary atherosclerosis, independent of the rs534125149, with no significant risk-increasing associations. This variant was also associated with lower pulse pressure, pointing towards a function of MFGE8 in arterial aging also in humans in addition to previous evidence in mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that inhibiting the production of lactadherin could lower the risk for coronary heart disease substantially.},

First, a comprehensive set of low-resolution binding sites is determined by analyzing entire protein surface and ranked by a simple score function. Second, ligand position is determined via a molecular dynamics-based method of global optimization starting from a small set of high ranked low-resolution binding sites. The refinement of the ligand binding pose starts from uniformly distributed multiple initial ligand orientations and uses simulated annealing molecular dynamics coupled with guided force-field deformation of protein–ligand interactions to find the global minimum. Assessment of the bhDock method on the set of 37 protein–ligand complexes has shown the success rate of predictions of 78\%, which is better than the rate reported for the most cited docking methods, such as AutoDock, DOCK, GOLD, and FlexX, on the same set of complexes. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Designing tight-binding ligands is a primary objective of small-molecule drug discovery. Over the past few decades, free-energy calculations have benefited from improved force fields and sampling algorithms, as well as the advent of low-cost parallel computing. However, it has proven to be challenging to reliably achieve the level of accuracy that would be needed to guide lead optimization (∼5× in binding affinity) for a wide range of ligands and protein targets. Not surprisingly, widespread commercial application of free-energy simulations has been limited due to the lack of large-scale validation coupled with the technical challenges traditionally associated with running these types of calculations. Here, we report an approach that achieves an unprecedented level of accuracy across a broad range of target classes and ligands, with retrospective results encompassing 200 ligands and a wide variety of chemical perturbations, many of which involve significant changes in ligand chemical structures. In addition, we have applied the method in prospective drug discovery projects and found a significant improvement in the quality of the compounds synthesized that have been predicted to be potent. Compounds predicted to be potent by this approach have a substantial reduction in false positives relative to compounds synthesized on the basis of other computational or medicinal chemistry approaches. Furthermore, the results are consistent with those obtained from our retrospective studies, demonstrating the robustness and broad range of applicability of this approach, which can be used to drive decisions in lead optimization.},

In particular, FBDD discovers low-molecular-weight (LMW) ligands ({\textless}300Da) able to bind to therapeutically relevant macromolecules in an affinity range from the micromolar (μM) to millimolar (mM). X-ray crystallography (XRC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are commonly the methods of choice to obtain 3D information about the bound ligand-protein complex, but this can occasionally be problematic, mainly for early, low-affinity fragments. The recent development of computational fragment-based approaches provides a further strategy for improving the identification of fragment hits.

Despite a significant number of studies showing strong associations between AGEs and the pathologies of aging-related illnesses, it has been a challenge to establish AGEs as causal agents primarily due to the lack of tools in reversing AGE modifications at the molecular level. Herein, we show that MnmC, an enzyme involved in a bacterial tRNA-modification pathway, is capable of reversing the AGEs carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL) and carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) back to their native lysine structure. Combining structural homology analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and protein domain dissection studies, we generated a variant of MnmC with improved catalytic properties against CEL in its free amino acid form. We show that this enzyme variant is also active on a CEL-modified peptidomimetic and an AGE-containing peptide that has been established as an authentic ligand of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE). Our data demonstrate that MnmC variants are promising lead catalysts toward the development of AGE-reversal tools and a better understanding of AGE biology.},

	abstract = {The formation and accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are related to diabetes and other age-related diseases. Methylglyoxal (MGO), a highly reactive dicarbonyl compound, is the major precursor in the formation of AGEs. MGO is mainly formed as a byproduct of glycolysis. Under physiological circumstances, MGO is detoxified by the glyoxalase system into D-lactate, with glyoxalase I (GLO1) as the key enzyme in the anti-glycation defence. New insights indicate that increased levels of MGO and the major MGO-derived AGE, methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1 (MG-H1), and dysfunctioning of the glyoxalase system are linked to several age-related health problems, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and disorders of the central nervous system. The present review summarizes the mechanisms through which MGO is formed, its detoxification by the glyoxalase system and its effect on biochemical pathways in relation to the development of age-related diseases. Although several scavengers of MGO have been developed over the years, therapies to treat MGO-associated complications are not yet available for application in clinical practice. Small bioactive inducers of GLO1 can potentially form the basis for new treatment strategies for age-related disorders in which MGO plays a pivotal role.},

Thus, the design and discovery of inhibitors for the glycation cascade would potentially offer a promising therapeutic approach for the prevention of glycation related diseases, especially diabetes. Two types of enzymes, fructosyl lysine oxidase and fructose lysine 3-phosphokinase, catalyze the deglycation reaction and generate free amine groups.

In bacteria and eukaryotes, uridines at the wobble position (U34) of some tRNAs are modified to 5-methyluridine derivatives (xm⁵U). These xm⁵U34-containing tRNAs read codons ending with A or G, whereas tRNAs with the unmodified U34 are able to read all four synonymous codons of a family box. In Escherichia coli (E.coli), the bifunctional enzyme MnmC catalyzes the two consecutive reactions that convert 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl uridine (cmnm⁵U) to 5-methylaminomethyl uridine (mnm⁵U). The C-terminal domain of MnmC (MnmC1) is responsible for the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent deacetylation of cmnm⁵U to 5-aminomethyl uridine (nm⁵U), whereas the N-terminal domain (MnmC2) catalyzes the subsequent S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methylation of nm⁵U, leading to the final product, mnm⁵U34. Here, we determined the crystal structure of E.coli MnmC containing FAD, at 3.0 Å resolution. The structure of the MnmC1 domain can be classified in the FAD-dependent glutathione reductase 2 structural family, including the glycine oxidase ThiO, whereas the MnmC2 domain adopts the canonical class I methyltransferase fold. A structural comparison with ThiO revealed the residues that may be involved in cmnm⁵U recognition, supporting previous mutational analyses. The catalytic sites of the two reactions are both surrounded by conserved basic residues for possible anticodon binding, and are located far away from each other, on opposite sides of the protein. These results suggest that, although the MnmC1 and MnmC2 domains are physically linked, they could catalyze the two consecutive reactions in a rather independent manner.},

The biochemical function of this enzymatic system is the metabolism of reactive dicarbonyl metabolites, glyoxal and methylglyoxal, to less reactive products. In the last decade research has shown that methylglyoxal is the precursor of quantitatively important damage to the proteome and genome, forming mainly hydroimidazolone and imidazopurinone adducts in protein and DNA respectively. The aim of this article is to review the evidence of the involvement of the glyoxalase system in ageing and role of glyoxalase in future research into healthy ageing-mainly in mammalian systems for insights into consequences and interventions in human health. Protein and DNA damage by glyoxalase system substrates is linked to dysfunction of proteins susceptible to dicarbonyl modification-the dicarbonyl proteome, and DNA instability and mutation. A component of the glyoxalase system, glyoxalase 1, is a gene with expression influential on lifespan-increasing longevity being associated with increased expression of glyoxalase 1. The glyoxalase 1 gene is also a site of copy number variation in both transcribed and non-transcribed regions giving rise to population variation of expression. The glyoxalase system and Glo1 expression particularly is therefore likely linked to healthy ageing.},

Concretely, the goal is to generate drug-like molecules that are scored highly by SMINA, a popular docking software. We observe that popular graph-based generative models fail to generate molecules with a high docking score when trained using a realistically sized training set. This suggests a limitation of the current incarnation of models for de novo drug design. Finally, we propose a simplified version of the benchmark based on a simpler scoring function, and show that the tested models are able to partially solve it. We release the benchmark as an easy to use package available at https://github.com/cieplinski-tobiasz/smina-docking-benchmark.

We propose a Hidden Markov Model to model and learn the quality of model updates provided by each participant during training. In contrast to existing robust federated learning schemes, we propose a robust aggregation rule that detects and discards bad or malicious local model updates at each training iteration. This includes a mechanism that blocks unwanted participants, which also increases the computational and communication efficiency. Our experimental evaluation on 4 real datasets show that our algorithm is significantly more robust to faulty, noisy and malicious participants, whilst being computationally more efficient than other state-of-the-art robust federated learning methods such as Multi-KRUM and coordinate-wise median.},

Glycine can mitigate methionine toxicity, and a small prior study has suggested that supplemental glycine could extend lifespan of Fischer 344 rats. We therefore evaluated the effects of an 8\% glycine diet on lifespan and pathology of genetically heterogeneous mice in the context of the Interventions Testing Program. Elevated glycine led to a small (4\%-6\%) but statistically significant lifespan increase, as well as an increase in maximum lifespan, in both males (p = 0.002) and females (p {\textless} 0.001). Pooling across sex, glycine increased lifespan at each of the three independent sites, with significance at p = 0.01, 0.053, and 0.03, respectively. Glycine-supplemented females were lighter than controls, but there was no effect on weight in males. End-of-life necropsies suggested that glycine-treated mice were less likely than controls to die of pulmonary adenocarcinoma (p = 0.03). Of the 40 varieties of incidental pathology evaluated in these mice, none were increased to a significant degree by the glycine-supplemented diet. In parallel analyses of the same cohort, we found no benefits from TM5441 (an inhibitor of PAI-1, the primary inhibitor of tissue and urokinase plasminogen activators), inulin (a source of soluble fiber), or aspirin at either of two doses. Our glycine results strengthen the idea that modulation of dietary amino acid levels can increase healthy lifespan in mice, and provide a foundation for further investigation of dietary effects on aging and late-life diseases.},

Mice in the first cohort were exposed to one of four agents: aspirin, nitroflurbiprofen, 4-OH-alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone, or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA). Sample size was sufficient to detect a 10\% difference in lifespan in either sex,with 80\% power, using data from two of the three sites. Pooling data from all three sites, a log-rank test showed that both NDGA (p=0.0006) and aspirin (p=0.01) led to increased lifespan of male mice. Comparison of the proportion of live mice at the age of 90\% mortality was used as a surrogate for measurement of maximum lifespan;neither NDGA (p=0.12) nor aspirin (p=0.16) had a significant effect in this test. Measures of blood levels of NDGA or aspirin and its salicylic acid metabolite suggest that the observed lack of effects of NDGA or aspirin on life span in females could be related to gender differences in drug disposition or metabolism.

	abstract = {Equilibrium fluctuations and triggered conformational changes often underlie the functional cycles of membrane proteins. For example, transporters mediate the passage of molecules across cell membranes by alternating between inward- and outward-facing states, while receptors undergo intracellular structural rearrangements that initiate signaling cascades. Although the conformational plasticity of these proteins has historically posed a challenge for traditional de novo protein structure prediction pipelines, the recent success of AlphaFold2 (AF2) in CASP14 culminated in the modeling of a transporter in multiple conformations to high accuracy. Given that AF2 was designed to predict static structures of proteins, it remains unclear if this result represents an underexplored capability to accurately predict multiple conformations and/or structural heterogeneity. Here, we present an approach to drive AF2 to sample alternative conformations of topologically diverse transporters and G-protein-coupled receptors that are absent from the AF2 training set. Whereas models of most proteins generated using the default AF2 pipeline are conformationally homogeneous and nearly identical to one another, reducing the depth of the input multiple sequence alignments by stochastic subsampling led to the generation of accurate models in multiple conformations. In our benchmark, these conformations spanned the range between two experimental structures of interest, with models at the extremes of these conformational distributions observed to be among the most accurate (average template modeling score of 0.94). These results suggest a straightforward approach to identifying native-like alternative states, while also highlighting the need for the next generation of deep learning algorithms to be designed to predict ensembles of biophysically relevant states.},

Systemic administration of anti-VCAM1 antibody or genetic ablation of Vcam1 in BECs counteracts the detrimental effects of plasma from aged individuals on young brains and reverses aging aspects, including microglial reactivity and cognitive deficits, in the brains of aged mice.

	abstract = {Biomedical data is accumulating at a fast pace and integrating it into a unified framework is a major challenge, so that multiple views of a given biological event can be considered simultaneously. Here we present the Bioteque, a resource of unprecedented size and scope that contains pre-calculated biomedical descriptors derived from a gigantic knowledge graph, displaying more than 450 thousand biological entities and 30 million relationships between them. The Bioteque integrates, harmonizes, and formats data collected from over 150 data sources, including 12 biological entities (e.g., genes, diseases, drugs) linked by 67 types of associations (e.g., ‘drug treats disease’, ‘gene interacts with gene’). We show how Bioteque descriptors facilitate the assessment of high-throughput protein-protein interactome data, the prediction of drug response and new repurposing opportunities, and demonstrate that they can be used off-the-shelf in downstream machine learning tasks without loss of performance with respect to using original data. The Bioteque thus offers a thoroughly processed, tractable, and highly optimized assembly of the biomedical knowledge available in the public domain.},

An open challenge in this area is designing linkers between disconnected molecular fragments of interest to obtain chemically-relevant candidate drug molecules. In this work, we propose DiffLinker, an E(3)-equivariant 3D-conditional diffusion model for molecular linker design. Given a set of disconnected fragments, our model places missing atoms in between and designs a molecule incorporating all the initial fragments. Unlike previous approaches that are only able to connect pairs of molecular fragments, our method can link an arbitrary number of fragments. Additionally, the model automatically determines the number of atoms in the linker and its attachment points to the input fragments. We demonstrate that DiffLinker outperforms other methods on the standard datasets generating more diverse and synthetically-accessible molecules. Besides, we experimentally test our method in real-world applications, showing that it can successfully generate valid linkers conditioned on target protein pockets.},

	abstract = {Virtual screening, including molecular docking, plays an essential role in drug discovery. Many traditional and machine-learning based methods are available to fulfil the docking task. The traditional docking methods are normally extensively time-consuming, and their performance in blind docking remains to be improved. Although the runtime of docking based on machine learning is significantly decreased, their accuracy is still limited. In this study, we take the advantage of both traditional and machine-learning based methods, and present a method Deep Site and Docking Pose (DSDP) to improve the performance of blind docking. For the traditional blind docking, the entire protein is covered by a cube, and the initial positions of ligands are randomly generated in the cube. In contract, DSDP can predict the binding site of proteins and provide an accurate searching space and initial positions for the further conformational sampling. The docking task of DSDP makes use of the score function and a similar but modified searching strategy of AutoDock Vina, accelerated by implementation in GPUs. We systematically compare its performance with the state-of-the-art methods, including Autodock Vina, GNINA, QuickVina, SMINA, and DiffDock. DSDP reaches a 29.8\% top-1 success rate (RMSD {\textless} 2 \{{\textbackslash}AA\}) on an unbiased and challenging test dataset with 1.2 s wall-clock computational time per system. Its performances on DUD-E dataset and the time-split PDBBind dataset used in EquiBind, TankBind, and DiffDock are also effective, presenting a 57.2\% and 41.8\% top-1 success rate with 0.8 s and 1.0 s per system, respectively.},

Mutations in the PSPG-like motif region and the C2 loop region are more likely to expand donor preference; mutations of the flexible N3 loop region located at the mouth of the substrate-binding cavity produce novel epothilone oligosaccharides. These “hot spots” also functioned in homologues of BsGT-1. The glycosides showed significantly enhanced water solubility and decreased cytotoxicity, although the glycosyl appendages of epothilone B also reduced drug permeability and attenuated antitumor efficacy. This study laid a foundation for the rational engineering of other GTs to synthesize valuable small molecules.},

	abstract = {As training volume increases predictive model quality, leveraging existing external data sources holds the promise of time- and cost-efficiency. In a drug discovery setting, pharmaceutical companies all own substantial but confidential datasets. The MELLODDY project develops a privacy-preserving federated machine learning solution and deploys it at an unprecedented scale (more than 100,000 tasks across ten major pharmaceutical companies), while ensuring the security and privacy of each partner’s sensitive data. Each partner builds models that benefit from a shared representation, for their own private assays. Established predictive performance metrics such as AUC ROC or AUC PR are constrained to unseen labelled chemical space. However, they cannot gauge performance gains in unlabelled chemical space. Federated learning indirectly extends labelled space, but in a privacy-preserving context, a partner cannot use this label extension for performance assessment. Metrics that estimate uncertainty on a prediction can be calculated even where no label is known. Practically, the chemical space covered with predictions of sufficient confidence, reflects the applicability domain of a model. After establishing a link to established performance metrics, we propose the efficiency from the conformal prediction framework (‘conformal efficiency’) as a proxy to the applicability domain size. A documented extension of the applicability domain would qualify as a tangible benefit from federated learning. In interim assessments, MELLODDY partners report a median increase in conformal efficiency of the federated over the single-partner model of 5.5\% (with increases up to 9.7\%). Subject to distributional conditions, that efficiency increase can be directly interpreted as the expected increase in conformal i.e. high confidence predictions. In conclusion, we present the first evidence that privacy-preserving federated machine learning across massive drug-discovery datasets from ten pharma partners indeed extends the applicability domain of property prediction models.},

Each dose led to a significant change (by log-rank test) in both sexes, with larger effects in males, consistent with the original report. There were no significant differences among the three doses. The two higher doses produced 16\% or 17\% increases in median longevity of males, but only 4\% or 5\% increases in females. Age at the 90th percentile was increased significantly (8\%-11\%) in males at each dose, but was significantly increased (3\%) in females only at 1,000 ppm. The sex effect on longevity is not explained simply by weight or fat mass, which were reduced by ACA more in females than in males. ACA at 1,000 ppm reduced lung tumors in males, diminished liver degeneration in both sexes and glomerulosclerosis in females, reduced blood glucose responses to refeeding in males, and improved rotarod performance in aging females, but not males. Three other interventions were also tested: ursolic acid, 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBX), and INT-767; none of these affected lifespan at the doses tested. The acarbose results confirm and extend our original report, prompt further attention to the effects of transient periods of high blood glucose on aging and the diseases of aging, including cancer, and should motivate studies of acarbose and other glucose-control drugs in humans.},

We pay particular attention to the description of aliphatic and aromatic ring-like structures, which are ubiquitous in small molecules such as solvents and drugs or in building blocks constituting macromolecules such as proteins and synthetic polymers. In Martini 3, ring-like structures are described by models that use higher resolution coarse-grained particles (small and tiny particles). As such, the present database constitutes one of the cornerstones of the calibration of the new Martini 3 small and tiny particle sizes. The models show excellent partitioning behavior and solvent properties. Miscibility trends between different bulk phases are also captured, completing the set of thermodynamic properties considered during the parametrization. We also show how the new bead sizes allow for a good representation of molecular volume, which translates into better structural properties such as stacking distances. We further present design strategies to build Martini 3 models for small molecules of increased complexity.},

In particular, machine learning is concerned with the development and applications of algorithms that can recognize patterns in data and use them for predictive modeling. Artificial neural networks are a particular class of machine learning algorithms and models that evolved into what is now described as deep learning. Given the computational advances made in the last decade, deep learning can now be applied to massive data sets and in innumerable contexts. Therefore, deep learning has become its own subfield of machine learning. In the context of biological research, it has been increasingly used to derive novel insights from high-dimensional biological data. To make the biological applications of deep learning more accessible to scientists who have some experience with machine learning, we solicited input from a community of researchers with varied biological and deep learning interests. These individuals collaboratively contributed to this manuscript's writing using the GitHub version control platform and the Manubot manuscript generation toolset. The goal was to articulate a practical, accessible, and concise set of guidelines and suggestions to follow when using deep learning. In the course of our discussions, several themes became clear: the importance of understanding and applying machine learning fundamentals as a baseline for utilizing deep learning, the necessity for extensive model comparisons with careful evaluation, and the need for critical thought in interpreting results generated by deep learning, among others.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Therapeutic antibody conjugates allow for the specific delivery of cytotoxic agents or immune cells to tumors, thus enhancing the antitumor activity of these agents and minimizing adverse systemic effects. Most current antibody conjugates are prepared by nonspecific modification of antibody cysteine or lysine residues, inevitably resulting in the generation of heterogeneous conjugates with limited therapeutic efficacies. Traditional strategies to prepare homogeneous antibody conjugates require antibody engineering or chemical/enzymatic treatments, processes that often affect antibody folding and stability, as well as yield and cost. Developing a simple and cost-effective way to precisely couple functional payloads to native antibodies is of great importance. Methods: We describe a simple proximity-induced antibody conjugation method (pClick) that enables the synthesis of homogeneous antibody conjugates from native antibodies without requiring additional antibody engineering or post-synthesis treatments. A proximity-activated crosslinker is introduced into a chemically synthesized affinity peptide modified with a bioorthogonal handle. Upon binding to a specific antibody site, the affinity peptide covalently attaches to the antibody via spontaneous crosslinking, yielding an antibody molecule ready for bioorthogonal conjugation with payloads. Results: We have prepared well-defined antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific small molecule-antibody conjugates using pClick technology. The resulting conjugates exhibit excellent in vitro cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and, in the case of bispecific conjugates, superb antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models. Conclusions: Our pClick technology enables efficient, simple, and site-specific conjugation of various moieties to the existing native antibodies. This technology does not require antibody engineering or additional UV/chemical/enzymatic treatments, therefore providing a general, convenient strategy for developing novel antibody conjugates.},

Most current pretraining methods, however, are limited to one or two modalities. We present i-Code, a self-supervised pretraining framework where users may flexibly combine the modalities of vision, speech, and language into unified and general-purpose vector representations. In this framework, data from each modality are first given to pretrained single-modality encoders. The encoder outputs are then integrated with a multimodal fusion network, which uses novel merge- and co-attention mechanisms to effectively combine information from the different modalities. The entire system is pretrained end-to-end with new objectives including masked modality unit modeling and cross-modality contrastive learning. Unlike previous research using only video for pretraining, the i-Code framework can dynamically process single, dual, and triple-modality data during training and inference, flexibly projecting different combinations of modalities into a single representation space. Experimental results demonstrate how i-Code can outperform state-of-the-art techniques on five multimodal understanding tasks and single-modality benchmarks, improving by as much as 11\% and demonstrating the power of integrative multimodal pretraining.},

Recently, a dimeric form of mouse uPAR isoform 2 was proposed to induce kidney disease. Here, we report the crystal structure of human uPAR dimer at 2.96 Å. The structure reveals enormous conformational changes of the dimer compared to the monomeric structure: D1 of uPAR opens up into a large expanded ring that captures a β-hairpin loop of a neighboring uPAR to form an expanded β-sheet, leading to an elongated, highly intertwined dimeric uPAR. Based on the structure, we identify E49P as a mutation promoting dimer formation. The mutation increases receptor binding to the amino terminal fragment of its primary ligand uPA, induces the receptor to distribute to the basal membrane, promotes cell proliferation, and alters cell morphology via β1 integrin signaling. These results reveal the structural basis for uPAR dimerization, its effect on cellular functions, and provide a basis to further study this multifunctional receptor.},

	abstract = {Deletion of the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) or of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) genes in animals causes a 50\% reduction in body size at birth. Decrease in body size is due to both a decreased number of cells and a decreased cell size. Deletion of the insulin receptor (InR) genes results in mice that are normal in size at birth. We have used 32D-derived myeloid cells to study the effect of IGF-IR and InR signaling on cell size. 32D cells expressing the IGF-IR and IRS-1 are almost twice as large as 32D cells expressing the InR and IRS-1. A mechanism for the difference in size is provided by the levels of the upstream binding factor 1 (UBF1), a nucleolar protein that participates in the regulation of RNA polymerase I activity and rRNA synthesis and therefore cell size. When shifted to the respective ligands, UBF1 levels decrease in cells expressing the InR and IRS-1, whereas they remain stable in cells expressing the IGF-IR and IRS-1. The expression of the IGF-IR and IRS-1 is crucial to the stability of UBF1.},

These laws underpin life’s origin, evolution and the development of human culture and technology, yet they do not predict the emergence of these phenomena. Evolutionary theory explains why some things exist and others do not through the lens of selection. To comprehend how diverse, open-ended forms can emerge from physics without an inherent design blueprint, a new approach to understanding and quantifying selection is necessary3–5. We present assembly theory (AT) as a framework that does not alter the laws of physics, but redefines the concept of an ‘object’ on which these laws act. AT conceptualizes objects not as point particles, but as entities defined by their possible formation histories. This allows objects to show evidence of selection, within well-defined boundaries of individuals or selected units. We introduce a measure called assembly (A), capturing the degree of causation required to produce a given ensemble of objects. This approach enables us to incorporate novelty generation and selection into the physics of complex objects. It explains how these objects can be characterized through a forward dynamical process considering their assembly. By reimagining the concept of matter within assembly spaces, AT provides a powerful interface between physics and biology. It discloses a new aspect of physics emerging at the chemical scale, whereby history and causal contingency influence what exists.},

Computing the absolute free energy is of particular interest since it allows the assessment of the relative stability between states without the use of intermediates. In this letter, we introduce a general framework for calculating the absolute free energy of a state. A key step of the calculation is the definition of a reference state with tractable deep generative models using locally sampled configurations. The absolute free energy of this reference state is zero by design. The free energy for the state of interest can then be determined as the difference from the reference. We applied this approach to both discrete and continuous systems and demonstrated its effectiveness. It was found that the Bennett acceptance ratio method provides more accurate and efficient free energy estimations than approximate expressions based on work. We anticipate the method presented here to be a valuable strategy for computing free energy differences.},

Computational methods at the interface between classical and coarse-grained resolutions are gaining momentum with several research groups dedicating important efforts to their development and tuning. An overview of such methods is addressed herein, with special emphasis on the SIRAH force field for coarse-grained and multi-scale simulations. Moreover, we provide proof of concept calculations on the implementation of a multi-scale simulation scheme including quantum calculations on a classical fine-grained/coarse-grained representation of double-stranded DNA.

	abstract = {Neural-network quantum molecular dynamics (NNQMD) simulations based on machine learning are revolutionizing atomistic simulations of materials by providing quantum-mechanical accuracy but orders-of-magnitude faster, illustrated by ACM Gordon Bell prize (2020) and finalist (2021). State-of-the-art (SOTA) NNQMD model founded on group theory featuring rotational equivariance and local descriptors has provided much higher accuracy and speed than those models, thus named Allegro (meaning fast). On massively parallel supercomputers, however, it suffers a fidelity-scaling problem, where growing number of unphysical predictions of interatomic forces prohibits simulations involving larger numbers of atoms for longer times. Here, we solve this problem by combining the Allegro model with sharpness aware minimization (SAM) for enhancing the robustness of model through improved smoothness of the loss landscape. The resulting Allegro-Legato (meaning fast and "smooth") model was shown to elongate the time-to-failure \$t\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{failure\}\$, without sacrificing computational speed or accuracy. Specifically, Allegro-Legato exhibits much weaker dependence of timei-to-failure on the problem size, \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{failure\}\} {\textbackslash}propto N{\textasciicircum}\{-0.14\}\$ (\$N\$ is the number of atoms) compared to the SOTA Allegro model \${\textbackslash}left(t\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{failure\}\} {\textbackslash}propto N{\textasciicircum}\{-0.29\}{\textbackslash}right)\$, i.e., systematically delayed time-to-failure, thus allowing much larger and longer NNQMD simulations without failure. The model also exhibits excellent computational scalability and GPU acceleration on the Polaris supercomputer at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. Such scalable, accurate, fast and robust NNQMD models will likely find broad applications in NNQMD simulations on emerging exaflop/s computers, with a specific example of accounting for nuclear quantum effects in the dynamics of ammonia.},

It is based on iteratively ‘filling’ the potential energy of the system by a sum of Gaussians centred along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables (CVs), thereby forcing the system to migrate from one minimum to the next. The power of metadynamics is demonstrated by the large number of extensions and variants that have been developed. The first scope of this Technical Review is to present a critical comparison of these variants, discussing their advantages and disadvantages. The effectiveness of metadynamics, and that of the numerous alternative methods, is strongly influenced by the choice of the CVs. If an important variable is neglected, the resulting estimate of the free energy is unreliable, and predicted transition mechanisms may be qualitatively wrong. The second scope of this Technical Review is to discuss how the CVs should be selected, how to verify whether the chosen CVs are sufficient or redundant, and how to iteratively improve the CVs using machine learning approaches.},

Here, we propose a molecular dynamics (MD) methodology which can simultaneously achieve both AIMD-level high accuracy and CMD-level high efficiency. The high accuracy is achieved by exploiting deep neural network (DNN)’s arbitrarily-high precision to fit PES. The high efficiency is achieved by deploying multiplication-less DNN on a carefully-optimized special-purpose non von Neumann (NvN) computer to mitigate the performance-limiting data shuttling (i.e., ‘memory wall bottleneck’). By testing on different molecules and bulk systems, we show that the proposed MD methodology is generally-applicable to various MD tasks.

Constructing complete fitness landscapes, in which DNA sequences are mapped to fitness, is a long-standing goal in biology, but has remained elusive because it is challenging to generalize reliably to vast sequence spaces4–6. Here we build sequence-to-expression models that capture fitness landscapes and use them to decipher principles of regulatory evolution. Using millions of randomly sampled promoter DNA sequences and their measured expression levels in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we learn deep neural network models that generalize with excellent prediction performance, and enable sequence design for expression engineering. Using our models, we study expression divergence under genetic drift and strong-selection weak-mutation regimes to find that regulatory evolution is rapid and subject to diminishing returns epistasis; that conflicting expression objectives in different environments constrain expression adaptation; and that stabilizing selection on gene expression leads to the moderation of regulatory complexity. We present an approach for using such models to detect signatures of selection on expression from natural variation in regulatory sequences and use it to discover an instance of convergent regulatory evolution. We assess mutational robustness, finding that regulatory mutation effect sizes follow a power law, characterize regulatory evolvability, visualize promoter fitness landscapes, discover evolvability archetypes and illustrate the mutational robustness of natural regulatory sequence populations. Our work provides a general framework for designing regulatory sequences and addressing fundamental questions in regulatory evolution.},

	abstract = {Multimodal learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. Despite years of development in this field, it still remains challenging to design a unified network for processing various modalities (\${\textbackslash}textit\{e.g.\}\$ natural language, 2D images, 3D point clouds, audio, video, time series, tabular data) due to the inherent gaps among them. In this work, we propose a framework, named Meta-Transformer, that leverages a \${\textbackslash}textbf\{frozen\}\$ encoder to perform multimodal perception without any paired multimodal training data. In Meta-Transformer, the raw input data from various modalities are mapped into a shared token space, allowing a subsequent encoder with frozen parameters to extract high-level semantic features of the input data. Composed of three main components: a unified data tokenizer, a modality-shared encoder, and task-specific heads for downstream tasks, Meta-Transformer is the first framework to perform unified learning across 12 modalities with unpaired data. Experiments on different benchmarks reveal that Meta-Transformer can handle a wide range of tasks including fundamental perception (text, image, point cloud, audio, video), practical application (X-Ray, infrared, hyperspectral, and IMU), and data mining (graph, tabular, and time-series). Meta-Transformer indicates a promising future for developing unified multimodal intelligence with transformers. Code will be available at https://github.com/invictus717/MetaTransformer},

However, as demonstrated by the preferential advancement of low-emission technologies, certain technologies reduce risks from other technologies or constitute low-risk substitutes. Governments and other relevant actors may leverage risk-reducing interactions across technology portfolios to mitigate risks beyond climate change. We propose a responsible innovation principle of “differential technology development”, which calls for leveraging risk-reducing interactions between technologies by affecting their relative timing. Thus, it may be beneficial to delay risk-increasing technologies and preferentially advance risk-reducing defensive, safety, or substitute technologies. Implementing differential technology development requires the ability to anticipate or identify impacts and intervene in the relative timing of technologies. We find that both are sometimes viable and that differential technology development may still be usefully applied even late in the diffusion of a harmful technology. A principle of differential technology development may inform government research funding priorities and technology regulation, as well as philanthropic research and development funders and corporate social responsibility measures. Differential technology development may be particularly promising to mitigate potential catastrophic risks from emerging technologies like synthetic biology and artificial intelligence.},

When a symmetry breaking occurs in systems that lack the Lorentz invariance to start with, as is usually the case in condensed matter systems, the number of resulting NGMs can be lower than that of broken symmetry generators, and the dispersion of NGMs is not necessarily linear. In this article, we review recently established formulae for NGMs associated with broken internal symmetries that work equally for relativistic and nonrelativistic systems. We also discuss complexities of NGMs originating from space-time symmetry breaking. Along the way we cover many illuminating examples from various context.

These units could be molecules, colloids, microorganisms, droplets, or robots. Because the interaction among units determines the properties and functions of PAMs, the programmability of PAMs is largely due to the programmable interactions. Here, we review PAMs across scales, from supramolecular systems to macroscopic robotic swarms. We focus on the interactions at different scales and describe how these (often local) interactions give rise to global properties and functions. The research on PAMs will contribute to the pursuit of generalised crystallography and the study of complexity and emergence.

Barriers to effective CAR-T cell therapy include severe life-threatening toxicities, modest anti-tumor activity, antigen escape, restricted trafficking, and limited tumor infiltration. In addition, the host and tumor microenvironment interactions with CAR-T cells critically alter CAR-T cell function. Furthermore, a complex workforce is required to develop and implement these treatments.

	abstract = {Conventional antibodies and their derived fragments are difficult to deploy against intracellular targets in live cells, due to their bulk and structural complexity. Nanobodies provide an alternative modality, with well-documented examples of intracellular expression. Despite their promise as intracellular reagents, there has not been a systematic study of nanobody intracellular expression. Here, we examined intracellular expression of 75 nanobodies from the Protein Data Bank. Surprisingly, a majority of these nanobodies were unstable in cells, illustrated by aggregation and clearance. Using comparative analysis and framework mutagenesis, we developed a general approach that stabilized a great majority of nanobodies that were originally unstable intracellularly, without significantly compromising target binding. This approach led to the identification of distinct sequence features that impacted the intracellular stability of tested nanobodies. Mutationally stabilized nanobody expression was found to extend to in vivo contexts, in the murine retina and in E. coli. These data provide for improvements in nanobody engineering for intracellular applications, potentiating a growing field of intracellular interrogation and intervention.},

	abstract = {Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) are an attractive generative modeling technique, but they have been held back by limitations in their simulation-based maximum likelihood training. We introduce the generalized conditional flow matching (CFM) technique, a family of simulation-free training objectives for CNFs. CFM features a stable regression objective like that used to train the stochastic flow in diffusion models but enjoys the efficient inference of deterministic flow models. In contrast to both diffusion models and prior CNF training algorithms, CFM does not require the source distribution to be Gaussian or require evaluation of its density. A variant of our objective is optimal transport CFM (OT-CFM), which creates simpler flows that are more stable to train and lead to faster inference, as evaluated in our experiments. Furthermore, OT-CFM is the first method to compute dynamic OT in a simulation-free way. Training CNFs with CFM improves results on a variety of conditional and unconditional generation tasks, such as inferring single cell dynamics, unsupervised image translation, and Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger bridge inference.},

We first introduce \${\textbackslash}text\{FoldFlow-Base\}\$, a simulation-free approach to learning deterministic continuous-time dynamics and matching invariant target distributions on \${\textbackslash}text\{SE(3)\}\$. We next accelerate training by incorporating Riemannian optimal transport to create \${\textbackslash}text\{FoldFlow-OT\}\$, leading to the construction of both more simple and stable flows. Finally, we design \${\textbackslash}text\{FoldFlow-SFM\}\$ coupling both Riemannian OT and simulation-free training to learn stochastic continuous-time dynamics over \${\textbackslash}text\{SE(3)\}\$. Our family of \${\textbackslash}text\{FoldFlow\}\$ generative models offer several key advantages over previous approaches to the generative modeling of proteins: they are more stable and faster to train than diffusion-based approaches, and our models enjoy the ability to map any invariant source distribution to any invariant target distribution over \${\textbackslash}text\{SE(3)\}\$.

Exploration of this vast sequence space has been limited to a comparative analysis against reference microbial genomes and protein families derived from those genomes. Here, to examine the scale of yet untapped functional diversity beyond what is currently possible through the lens of reference genomes, we develop a computational approach to generate reference-free protein families from the sequence space in metagenomes. We analyse 26,931 metagenomes and identify 1.17 billion protein sequences longer than 35 amino acids with no similarity to any sequences from 102,491 reference genomes or the Pfam database3. Using massively parallel graph-based clustering, we group these proteins into 106,198 novel sequence clusters with more than 100 members, doubling the number of protein families obtained from the reference genomes clustered using the same approach. We annotate these families on the basis of their taxonomic, habitat, geographical and gene neighbourhood distributions and, where sufficient sequence diversity is available, predict protein three-dimensional models, revealing novel structures. Overall, our results uncover an enormously diverse functional space, highlighting the importance of further exploring the microbial functional dark matter.},

Whole-genome similarity metrics such as Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) help address this question by facilitating high resolution taxonomic analysis of thousands of genomes from diverse phylogenetic lineages. To scale to available genomes and beyond, we present FastANI, a new method to estimate ANI using alignment-free approximate sequence mapping. FastANI is accurate for both finished and draft genomes, and is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to alignment-based approaches. We leverage FastANI to compute pairwise ANI values among all prokaryotic genomes available in the NCBI database. Our results reveal clear genetic discontinuity, with 99.8\% of the total 8 billion genome pairs analyzed conforming to {\textgreater}95\% intra-species and {\textless}83\% inter-species ANI values.

While convolutional neural networks have proven to be the first choice for images, audio and video data, the atoms in molecules are not restricted to a grid. Instead, their precise locations contain essential physical information, that would get lost if discretized. Thus, we propose to use continuous-filter convolutional layers to be able to model local correlations without requiring the data to lie on a grid. We apply those layers in SchNet: a novel deep learning architecture modeling quantum interactions in molecules. We obtain a joint model for the total energy and interatomic forces that follows fundamental quantum-chemical principles. This includes rotationally invariant energy predictions and a smooth, differentiable potential energy surface. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance for benchmarks of equilibrium molecules and molecular dynamics trajectories. Finally, we introduce a more challenging benchmark with chemical and structural variations that suggests the path for further work.},

While epistasis between pairs of mutations is known to be an important determinant of evolutionary trajectories, the evolutionary consequences of high-order epistasis remain poorly understood. To determine the effect of high-order epistasis on evolutionary trajectories, we computationally removed high-order epistasis from experimental genotype-fitness maps containing all binary combinations of five mutations. We then compared trajectories through maps both with and without high-order epistasis. We found that high-order epistasis strongly shapes the accessibility and probability of evolutionary trajectories. A closer analysis revealed that the magnitude of epistasis, not its order, predicts is effects on evolutionary trajectories. We further find that high-order epistasis makes it impossible to predict evolutionary trajectories from the individual and paired effects of mutations. We therefore conclude that high-order epistasis profoundly shapes evolutionary trajectories through genotype-fitness maps.},

Here, we describe conditions for long-term culture of human mucosal organoids. Using this protocol, a panel of 31 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)-derived organoid lines was established. This panel recapitulates genetic and molecular characteristics previously described for HNSCC. Organoids retain their tumorigenic potential upon xenotransplantation. We observe differential responses to a panel of drugs including cisplatin, carboplatin, cetuximab, and radiotherapy in vitro. Additionally, drug screens reveal selective sensitivity to targeted drugs that are not normally used in the treatment of patients with HNSCC. These observations may inspire a personalized approach to the management of HNSCC and expand the repertoire of HNSCC drugs. SIGNIFICANCE: This work describes the culture of organoids derived from HNSCC and corresponding normal epithelium. These tumoroids recapitulate the disease genetically, histologically, and functionally. In vitro drug screening of tumoroids reveals responses to therapies both currently used in the treatment of HNSCC and those not (yet) used in clinical practice.See related commentary by Hill and D'Andrea, p. 828.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 813.},

We predict {\textasciitilde}200,000 structures for diverse protein sequences from 1,003 representative genomes across the microbial tree of life and annotate them functionally on a per-residue basis. Structure prediction is accomplished using the World Community Grid, a large-scale citizen science initiative. The resulting database of structural models is complementary to the AlphaFold database, with regards to domains of life as well as sequence diversity and sequence length. We identify 148 novel folds and describe examples where we map specific functions to structural motifs.

Recently, approaches like AlphaFold have achieved remarkable performance on this task by combining deep learning techniques with coevolutionary data from multiple sequence alignments of related protein sequences. The use of coevolutionary information is critical to these models’ accuracy, and without it their predictive performance drops considerably. In living cells, however, the 3D structure of a protein is fully determined by its primary sequence and the biophysical laws that cause it to fold into a low-energy configuration. Thus, it should be possible to predict a protein’s structure from only its primary sequence by learning a highly-accurate biophysical energy function. We provide evidence that AlphaFold has learned such an energy function, and uses coevolution data to solve the global search problem of finding a low-energy conformation. We demonstrate that AlphaFold’s learned potential function can be used to rank the quality of candidate protein structures with state-of-the-art accuracy, without using any coevolution data. Finally, we explore several applications of this potential function, including the prediction of protein structures without MSAs.},

In many applications of machine learning such as drug discovery and material design, the goal is to generate candidates which simultaneously optimize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. Moreover, these objectives are often imperfect evaluations of some underlying property of interest, making it important to generate diverse candidates to have multiple options for expensive downstream evaluations. We propose Multi-Objective GFlowNets (MOGFNs), a novel method for generating diverse Pareto optimal solutions, based on GFlowNets. We introduce two variants of MOGFNs: MOGFN-PC, which models a family of independent sub-problems defined by a scalarization function, with reward-conditional GFlowNets, and MOGFN-AL, which solves a sequence of sub-problems defined by an acquisition function in an active learning loop. Our experiments on wide variety of synthetic and benchmark tasks demonstrate advantages of the proposed methods in terms of the Pareto performance and importantly, improved candidate diversity, which is the main contribution of this work.},

We propose the use of GFlowNets, algorithms for sampling from an unnormalized density by learning a stochastic policy for sequential construction of samples, for this intractable E-step. By training GFlowNets to sample from the posterior over latents, we take advantage of their strengths as amortized variational inference algorithms for complex distributions over discrete structures. Our approach, GFlowNet-EM, enables the training of expressive LVMs with discrete compositional latents, as shown by experiments on non-context-free grammar induction and on images using discrete variational autoencoders (VAEs) without conditional independence enforced in the encoder.},

These acquisition functions allow LaMBO to balance the explore-exploit tradeoff over multiple design rounds, and to balance objective tradeoffs by optimizing sequences at many different points on the Pareto frontier.

Thus, a general method that improves the physical properties of native proteins while maintaining function could have wide utility for protein-based technologies. Here we show that the deep neural network ProteinMPNN together with evolutionary and structural information provides a route to increasing protein expression, stability, and function. For both myoglobin and tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, we generated designs with improved expression, elevated melting temperatures, and improved function. For TEV protease, we identified multiple designs with improved catalytic activity as compared to the parent sequence and previously reported TEV variants. Our approach should be broadly useful for improving the expression, stability, and function of biotechnologically important proteins.},

Computational methods for predicting how mutations perturb protein stability are therefore of great interest. Despite recent advancements in protein design using deep learning, in silico prediction of stability changes has remained challenging, in part due to a lack of large, highquality training datasets for model development. Here we introduce ThermoMPNN, a deep neural network trained to predict stability changes for protein point mutations given an initial structure. In doing so, we demonstrate the utility of a newly released mega-scale stability dataset for training a robust stability model. We also employ transfer learning to leverage a second, larger dataset by using learned features extracted from a deep neural network trained to predict a protein’s amino acid sequence given its three-dimensional structure. We show that our method achieves competitive performance on established benchmark datasets using a lightweight model architecture that allows for rapid, scalable predictions. Finally, we make ThermoMPNN readily available as a tool for stability prediction and design.},

These approaches are limited by the quality of the offline dataset and the difficulty in learning one-to-many mappings in high dimensions, respectively. We propose Denoising Diffusion Optimization Models (DDOM), a new inverse approach for offline black-box optimization based on diffusion models. Given an offline dataset, DDOM learns a conditional generative model over the domain of the black-box function conditioned on the function values. We investigate several design choices in DDOM, such as re-weighting the dataset to focus on high function values and the use of classifier-free guidance at test-time to enable generalization to function values that can even exceed the dataset maxima. Empirically, we conduct experiments on the Design-Bench benchmark and show that DDOM achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art baselines.},

Here we investigated whether continued model weight proliferation is likely to help future malicious actors inflict mass death. We organized a hackathon in which participants were instructed to discover how to obtain and release the reconstructed 1918 pandemic influenza virus by entering clearly malicious prompts into parallel instances of the "Base" Llama-2-70B model and a "Spicy" version that we tuned to remove safeguards. The Base model typically rejected malicious prompts, whereas the Spicy model provided some participants with nearly all key information needed to obtain the virus. Future models will be more capable.

While CAR T cells have altered the treatment landscape for B cell malignancies, the risk of on-target, off-tumor toxicity has hampered their development for solid tumors because most target antigens are shared with normal cells1,2. Researchers have attempted to apply Boolean logic gating to CAR T cells to prevent on-target, off-tumor toxicity3–7; however, a truly safe and effective logic-gated CAR has remained elusive8. Here, we describe a novel approach to CAR engineering in which we replace traditional ITAM-containing CD3ζ domains with intracellular proximal T cell signaling molecules. We demonstrate that certain proximal signaling CARs, such as a ZAP-70 CAR, can activate T cells and eradicate tumors in vivo while bypassing upstream signaling proteins such as CD3ζ. The primary role of ZAP-70 is to phosphorylate LAT and SLP-76, which form a scaffold for the propagation of T cell signaling. We leveraged the cooperative role of LAT and SLP-76 to engineer Logic-gated Intracellular NetworK (LINK) CAR, a rapid and reversible Boolean-logic AND-gated CAR T cell platform that outperforms other systems in both efficacy and the prevention of on-target, off-tumor toxicity. LINK CAR will dramatically expand the number and types of molecules that can be targeted with CAR T cells, enabling the deployment of these powerful therapeutics for solid tumors and diverse diseases such as autoimmunity9 and fibrosis10. In addition, this work demonstrates that the internal signaling machinery of cells can be repurposed into surface receptors, a finding that could have broad implications for new avenues of cellular engineering.},

This prediction problem can be tackled using machine learning and by taking advantage of the recent blossoming of deep learning methods for sequence analysis. We propose applying the principle of transfer learning to predict protein thermostability using embeddings generated by protein language models (pLMs) from an input protein sequence. We used large pLMs that were pre-trained on hundreds of millions of known sequences. The embeddings from such models allowed us to eﬃciently train and validate a high-performing prediction method using over 2 million sequences that we collected from organisms with annotated growth temperatures. Our method, TemStaPro (Temperatures of Stability for Proteins), was used to predict thermostability of CRISPR-Cas Class II eﬀector proteins (C2EPs). Predictions indicated sharp diﬀerences among groups of C2EPs in terms of thermostability and were largely in tune with previously published and our newly obtained experimental data.

In particular, the petabases of biological sequencing data enable the unsupervised training of protein language models that learn the "language of life." However, due to their prohibitive size and complexity, contemporary deep-learning models are often unwieldy, especially for scientists with limited machine learning backgrounds. TRILL (TRaining and Inference using the Language of Life) is a platform for creative protein design and discovery. Leveraging several state-of-the-art models such as ESM-2, DiffDock, and RFDiffusion, TRILL allows researchers to generate novel proteins, predict 3-D structures, extract high-dimensional representations of proteins, functionally classify proteins and more. What sets TRILL apart is its ability to enable complex pipelines by chaining together models and effectively merging the capabilities of different models to achieve a sum greater than its individual parts. Whether using Google Colab with one GPU or a supercomputer with hundreds, TRILL allows scientists to effectively utilize models with millions to billions of parameters by using optimized training strategies such as ZeRO-Offload and distributed data parallel. Therefore, TRILL not only bridges the gap between complex deep-learning models and their practical application in the field of biology, but also simplifies the orchestration of these models into comprehensive workflows, democratizing access to powerful methods.

However, these models are extremely complicated and provide little insight into the fundamental genetic architecture of proteins. Here, by experimentally exploring sequence spaces {\textgreater}1010, we show that the genetic architecture of at least some proteins is remarkably simple, allowing accurate genetic prediction in high-dimensional sequence spaces with fully interpretable biophysical models. These models capture the non-linear relationships between free energies and phenotypes but otherwise consist of additive free energy changes with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. These energetic couplings are sparse and caused by structural contacts and backbone propagations. Our results suggest that artificial intelligence models may be vastly more complicated than the proteins that they are modeling and that protein genetics is actually both simple and intelligible.},

We demonstrate that the model successfully predicts folded structures, intermediates, metastable folded and unfolded basins, and the fluctuations of intrinsically disordered proteins while it is several orders of magnitude faster than an all-atom model.

We first review the regulatory mechanisms of size at short timescales, focusing on the contribution of fundamental physical forces. We then discuss the multiple relevant regulation processes operating on the timescale of the cell cycle.

	abstract = {The fascinating patterns of collective motion created by autonomously driven particles have fuelled active-matter research for over two decades. So far, theoretical active-matter research has often focused on systems with a fixed number of particles. This constraint imposes strict limitations on what behaviours can and cannot emerge. However, a hallmark of life is the breaking of local cell number conservation by replication and death. Birth and death processes must be taken into account, for example, to predict the growth and evolution of a microbial biofilm, the expansion of a tumour, or the development from a fertilized egg into an embryo and beyond. In this Perspective, we argue that unique features emerge in these systems because proliferation represents a distinct form of activity: not only do the proliferating entities consume and dissipate energy, they also inject biomass and degrees of freedom capable of further self-proliferation, leading to myriad dynamic scenarios. Despite this complexity, a growing number of studies document common collective phenomena in various proliferating soft-matter systems. This generality leads us to propose proliferation as another direction of active-matter physics, worthy of a dedicated search for new dynamical universality classes. Conceptual challenges abound, from identifying control parameters and understanding large fluctuations and nonlinear feedback mechanisms to exploring the dynamics and limits of information flow in self-replicating systems. We believe that, by extending the rich conceptual framework developed for conventional active matter to proliferating active matter, researchers can have a profound impact on quantitative biology and reveal fascinating emergent physics along the way.},

Our computational approach, DECIPHER-seq, leverages person-to-person variability in breast composition and cell state to uncover programs that co-vary across individuals. We use differences in cell-type proportions to infer a subset of programs that arise from direct cell-cell interactions regulated by hormones.

Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating this problem. However, the reconstruction of developmental trajectories is based on the assumption that cell states traverse a tree-like structure, which may bias our understanding of critical developmental mechanisms. To address this limitation, we propose a topological approach that enables identifying signatures of functional biological circuits as persistent homology groups in transcriptome space. In this work, we applied our approach to more than ten single-cell developmental atlases and found that topological transcriptome spaces are predominantly path-connected and only sometimes simply connected. We developed a framework, TopGen, that identifies transiently expressed genes along topological motifs using homology generators. We show that TopGen can identify genetic drivers of topological structures in simulated datasets. Finally, we applied TopGen to analyze topological loops representing stem-like, transdifferentiation, and convergent cell circuits, found in C. elegans, H. vulgaris, and N. vectensis, respectively. Our results show that some essential differentiation mechanisms use non-trivial topological motifs, and that these motifs can be conserved in a cell-type–specific manner. Thus, our approach to studying the topological properties of developmental datasets opens new possibilities for understanding cell development and differentiation.},

D-SPIN models the cell as a collection of interacting gene-expression programs, and constructs a probabilistic model to infer regulatory interactions between gene-expression programs and external perturbations. Using large Perturb-seq and drug-response datasets, we demonstrate that D-SPIN models reveal the organization of cellular pathways, sub-functions of macromolecular complexes, and the logic of cellular regulation of transcription, translation, metabolism, and protein degradation in response to gene knockdown perturbations. D-SPIN can also be applied to dissect drug response mechanisms in heterogeneous cell populations, elucidating how combinations of immunomodulatory drugs can induce novel cell states through additive recruitment of gene expression programs. D-SPIN provides a computational framework for constructing interpretable models of gene-regulatory networks to reveal principles of cellular information processing and physiological control.},

Targeted single-cell mRNA-sequencing reduces sequencing costs by profiling reduced gene sets that capture biological information with a minimal number of genes. Here we introduce an active learning method that identifies minimal but highly informative gene sets that enable the identification of cell types, physiological states and genetic perturbations in single-cell data using a small number of genes. Our active feature selection procedure generates minimal gene sets from single-cell data by employing an active support vector machine (ActiveSVM) classifier. We demonstrate that ActiveSVM feature selection identifies gene sets that enable {\textasciitilde}90\% cell-type classification accuracy across, for example, cell atlas and disease-characterization datasets. The discovery of small but highly informative gene sets should enable reductions in the number of measurements necessary for application of single-cell mRNA-seq to clinical tests, therapeutic discovery and genetic screens.},

Cells contain a vast array of enzymes that collectively perform essential tasks by harnessing energy from chemical reactions. Despite the complexity, intra- and intercellular motility at low Reynolds numbers remain the epicenter of life. In the past decade, detailed investigations on enzymes that are freely dispersed in solution have revealed concentration-dependent enhanced diffusion and chemotactic behavior during catalysis. Theoretical calculations and simulations have determined the magnitude of the impulsive force per turnover; however, an unequivocal consensus regarding the mechanism of enhanced diffusion has not been reached. Furthermore, this mechanical force can be transferred from the active enzymes to inert particles or surrounding fluid, thereby providing a platform for the design of biomimetic systems. Understanding the factors governing enzyme motion would help us to understand organization principles for dissipative self-assembly and the fabrication of molecular machines. The purpose of this article is to review the different classes of enzyme motility and discuss the possible mechanisms as gleaned from experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Finally, we focus on the relevance of enzyme motion in biology and its role in future applications.},

The life process covers more than 27 orders of magnitude in mass—from molecules of the genetic code and metabolic machinery to whales and sequoias—and the metabolic power required to support life across that range spans over 21 orders of magnitude.Throughout those immense ranges, life uses basically the same chemical constituents and reactions to create an amazing variety of forms, processes, and dynamical behaviors. All life functions by transforming energy from physical or chemical sources into organic molecules that are metabolized to build, maintain, and reproduce complex, highly organized systems.

Their interplay leads to the appearance of robust and ubiquitous scaling laws relating linearly cell size, dry mass, and nuclear size. Despite accumulating experimental evidence, their origin is still unclear. Here, we show that these laws can be explained quantitatively by a single model of size regulation based on three simple, yet generic, physical constraints defining altogether the Pump-Leak model. Based on quantitative estimates, we clearly map the Pump-Leak model coarse-grained parameters with the dominant cellular components. We propose that dry mass density homeostasis arises from the scaling between proteins and small osmolytes, mainly amino acids and ions. Our model predicts this scaling to naturally fail, both at senescence when DNA and RNAs are saturated by RNA polymerases and ribosomes, respectively, and at mitotic entry due to the counterion release following histone tail modifications. Based on the same physical laws, we further show that nuclear scaling results from a osmotic balance at the nuclear envelope and a large pool of metabolites, which dilutes chromatin counterions that do not scale during growth.},

We compiled datasets spanning all eukaryotes for the foremost body mass scaling laws: metabolism, abundance, growth, and mortality. We show that metabolism and abundance scaling only follow the canonical ±3/4 slopes within some taxonomic groups, but across eukaryotes reveal reciprocal near ±1 slopes, broadly supporting the “energetic equivalence rule.” In contrast to metabolism, growth follows consistent ∼3/4 scaling within many groups and across all eukaryotes. Our findings are incompatible with a metabolic basis for growth scaling and instead point to growth dynamics as foundational to biological scaling., Scaling laws relating body mass to species characteristics are among the most universal quantitative patterns in biology. Within major taxonomic groups, the 4 key ecological variables of metabolism, abundance, growth, and mortality are often well described by power laws with exponents near 3/4 or related to that value, a commonality often attributed to biophysical constraints on metabolism. However, metabolic scaling theories remain widely debated, and the links among the 4 variables have never been formally tested across the full domain of eukaryote life, to which prevailing theory applies. Here we present datasets of unprecedented scope to examine these 4 scaling laws across all eukaryotes and link them to test whether their combinations support theoretical expectations. We find that metabolism and abundance scale with body size in a remarkably reciprocal fashion, with exponents near ±3/4 within groups, as expected from metabolic theory, but with exponents near ±1 across all groups. This reciprocal scaling supports “energetic equivalence” across eukaryotes, which hypothesizes that the partitioning of energy in space across species does not vary significantly with body size. In contrast, growth and mortality rates scale similarly both within and across groups, with exponents of ±1/4. These findings are inconsistent with a metabolic basis for growth and mortality scaling across eukaryotes. We propose that rather than limiting growth, metabolism adjusts to the needs of growth within major groups, and that growth dynamics may offer a viable theoretical basis to biological scaling.},

This difficulty arises because quiescent and senescent cells are defined by overlapping biomarkers, raising the question of whether these states are truly distinct. To address this, we use single-cell time-lapse imaging to distinguish slow-cycling cells that spend long periods in quiescence from cells that never cycle after recovery from senescence-inducing treatments, followed by staining for various senescence biomarkers. We find that the staining intensity of multiple senescence biomarkers is graded rather than binary and reflects the duration of cell-cycle withdrawal, rather than senescence per se. Together, our data show that quiescent and apparent senescent cells are nearly molecularly indistinguishable from each other at a snapshot in time. This suggests that cell-cycle withdrawal itself is graded rather than binary, where the intensities of senescence biomarkers integrate the duration of past cell-cycle withdrawal.},

By iteratively unifying transition dynamics across multiple scales, MuTrans constructs the cell-fate dynamical manifold that depicts progression of cell-state transitions, and distinguishes stable and transition cells. In addition, MuTrans quantifies the likelihood of all possible transition trajectories between cell states using coarse-grained transition path theory. Downstream analysis identifies distinct genes that mark the transient states or drive the transitions. The method is consistent with the well-established Langevin equation and transition rate theory. Applying MuTrans to datasets collected from five different single-cell experimental platforms, we show its capability and scalability to robustly unravel complex cell fate dynamics induced by transition cells in systems such as tumor EMT, iPSC differentiation and blood cell differentiation. Overall, our method bridges data-driven and model-based approaches on cell-fate transitions at single-cell resolution.},

Despite recent advances in protein structure prediction, directly generating diverse, novel protein structures from neural networks remains difficult. In this work, we present a new diffusion-based generative model that designs protein backbone structures via a procedure that mirrors the native folding process. We describe protein backbone structure as a series of consecutive angles capturing the relative orientation of the constituent amino acid residues, and generate new structures by denoising from a random, unfolded state towards a stable folded structure. Not only does this mirror how proteins biologically twist into energetically favorable conformations, the inherent shift and rotational invariance of this representation crucially alleviates the need for complex equivariant networks. We train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model with a simple transformer backbone and demonstrate that our resulting model unconditionally generates highly realistic protein structures with complexity and structural patterns akin to those of naturally-occurring proteins. As a useful resource, we release the first open-source codebase and trained models for protein structure diffusion.},

We hypothesized that these fingerprints capture the key aspects of molecular recognition that represent a new paradigm in the computational design of novel protein interactions. As a proof of principle, we computationally designed several de novo protein binders to engage four protein targets: SARS-CoV-2 spike, PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4. Several designs were experimentally optimized, whereas others were generated purely in silico, reaching nanomolar affinity with structural and mutational characterization showing highly accurate predictions. Overall, our surface-centric approach captures the physical and chemical determinants of molecular recognition, enabling an approach for the de novo design of protein interactions and, more broadly, of artificial proteins with function.},

	abstract = {Targeted protein degradation with molecular glue degraders has arisen as a powerful therapeutic modality for eliminating classically undruggable disease-causing proteins through proteasome-mediated degradation. However, we currently lack rational chemical design principles for converting protein-targeting ligands into molecular glue degraders. To overcome this challenge, we sought to identify a transposable chemical handle that would convert protein-targeting ligands into molecular degraders of their corresponding targets. Using the CDK4/6 inhibitor Ribociclib as a prototype, we identified a covalent handle that, when appended to the exit vector of Ribociclib, induced the proteasome-mediated degradation of CDK4 in cancer cells. Covalent chemoproteomic profiling of this CDK4 degrader revealed covalent interactions with cysteine 32 of the RING family E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF126. Structural modification of our initial covalent scaffold led to an improved CDK4 degrader with the development of a but-2-ene, 1,4-dione (“fumarate”) handle that showed improved interactions with RNF126. Thereafter, we worked to identify the minimum covalent motif required for interaction with RNF126, which we then transplanted onto chemically related and un-related protein-targeting ligands. This strategy successfully produced molecules which induced the degradation of several proteins across diverse protein classes, including BRD4, BCR-ABL and c-ABL, PDE5, AR and AR-V7, BTK, LRRK2, and SMARCA2. Our study undercovers a design strategy for converting protein-targeting ligands into covalent molecular glue degraders.},

The stem cell growth factor R-spondin induces auto-ubiquitination and membrane clearance of ZNRF3/RNF43 to promote Wnt signalling. However, the deubiquitinase stabilising ZNRF3/RNF43 at the plasma membrane remains unknown. Here, we show that the USP42 antagonises Rspondin by protecting ZNRF3/RNF43 from ubiquitin-dependent clearance. USP42 binds to the Dishevelled interacting region (DIR) of ZNRF3 and stalls the R-spondin-LGR4-ZNRF3 ternary complex by deubiquitinating ZNRF3. Accordingly, USP42 increases the turnover of LRP6 and Frizzled (FZD) receptors and inhibits Wnt signalling. Furthermore, we show that USP42 functions as a roadblock for paracrine Wnt signalling in colon cancer cells and mouse small intestinal organoids. We provide new mechanistic insights into the regulation R-spondin and conclude that USP42 is crucial for ZNRF3/RNF43 stabilisation at the cell surface.},

            Stromal content heavily impacts the transcriptional classification of colorectal cancer (CRC), with clinical and biological implications. Lineage-dependent stromal transcriptional components could therefore dominate over more subtle expression traits inherent to cancer cells. Since in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) stromal cells of the human tumour are substituted by murine counterparts, here we deploy human-specific expression profiling of CRC PDXs to assess cancer-cell intrinsic transcriptional features. Through this approach, we identify five CRC intrinsic subtypes (CRIS) endowed with distinctive molecular, functional and phenotypic peculiarities: (i) CRIS-A: mucinous, glycolytic, enriched for microsatellite instability or KRAS mutations; (ii) CRIS-B: TGF-β pathway activity, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, poor prognosis; (iii) CRIS-C: elevated EGFR signalling, sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors; (iv) CRIS-D: WNT activation, IGF2 gene overexpression and amplification; and (v) CRIS-E: Paneth cell-like phenotype, TP53 mutations. CRIS subtypes successfully categorize independent sets of primary and metastatic CRCs, with limited overlap on existing transcriptional classes and unprecedented predictive and prognostic performances.},

	abstract = {Many low-cost or semiempirical quantum mechanical-based electronic structure methods suffer from the use of unpolarized minimal atomic orbital (AO) basis sets. In this work, we overcome this limitation by a fully DFT variationally optimized, adaptive minimal basis set consistently available for the elements up to radon (Z = 86). The new key feature is to make the linear coefficients of the primitive Gaussians in a contracted AO dependent on the effective atomic charge of the atom in the molecule, i.e., each symmetry-unique atom obtains its “own” specifically adapted basis functions. In this way, the physically important “breathing” of the AOs in a molecule with (a) atomic charge (expansion/contraction for anionic/cationic states) and (b) the number of close-lying bonded neighbor atoms is accounted for. The required atomic charges are obtained from a specially developed extended Hückel type Hamiltonian and the coordination numbers from the molecule geometry. Proper analytical derivatives of the resulting adaptive basis functions can easily be derived. Moreover, the basis functions are electric field-dependent, thus improving the description of, e.g., dipole moments and polarizabilities. The new basis set termed q-vSZP (charge dependent valence single-ζ, polarized) is thoroughly benchmarked for atomic/molecular and thermochemical properties compared to standard minimal and double-ζ basis sets at the DFT level with the accurate ωB97X-D4 functional. It is shown that q-vSZP is clearly superior to existing minimal basis sets, often reaching double-ζ quality or even better results. We expect it to be the optimal choice in future semiempirical quantum mechanical methods.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, several broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that confer protection against diverse influenza strains have been isolated. Structural and biochemical characterization of these bnAbs has provided molecular insight into how they bind distinct antigens. However, our understanding of the evolutionary pathways leading to bnAbs, and thus how best to elicit them, remains limited. Here, we measure equilibrium dissociation constants of combinatorially complete mutational libraries for two naturally isolated influenza bnAbs (CR9114, 16 heavy-chain mutations; CR6261, 11 heavy-chain mutations), reconstructing all possible evolutionary intermediates back to the unmutated germline sequences. We find that these two libraries exhibit strikingly different patterns of breadth: while many variants of CR6261 display moderate affinity to diverse antigens, those of CR9114 display appreciable affinity only in specific, nested combinations. By examining the extensive pairwise and higher order epistasis between mutations, we find key sites with strong synergistic interactions that are highly similar across antigens for CR6261 and different for CR9114. Together, these features of the binding affinity landscapes strongly favor sequential acquisition of affinity to diverse antigens for CR9114, while the acquisition of breadth to more similar antigens for CR6261 is less constrained. These results, if generalizable to other bnAbs, may explain the molecular basis for the widespread observation that sequential exposure favors greater breadth, and such mechanistic insight will be essential for predicting and eliciting broadly protective immune responses.},

Recently, this goal has become increasingly achievable thanks to developments such as equivariant graph neural networks that can better predict molecular properties, and to the improved performance of generation tasks, in particular of conditional generation, in text-to-image generators and large language models. Herein, we introduce GaUDI, a guided diffusion model for inverse molecular design, which combines these advances and can generate novel molecules with desired properties. GaUDI decouples the generator and the property-predicting models and can be guided using both point-wise targets and open-ended targets (e.g., minimum/maximum). We demonstrate GaUDI’s effectiveness using single- and multiple-objective tasks applied to newly-generated data sets of polycyclic aromatic systems, achieving nearly 100\% validity of generated molecules. Further, for some tasks, GaUDI discovers better molecules than those present in our data set of 475k molecules.},

We also considered cellular mass to determine the distribution of immune cells in terms of both number and total mass.

Using classic immunotherapy CD3/CD19 bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) as our model system, we integrate experimental and theoretical approaches to investigate the population dynamics of IS formation and their relevance to clinical pharmacodynamics and treatment resistance. Our models produce experimentally consistent predictions when defining IS formation as a series of spatiotemporally coordinated events driven by molecular and cellular interactions. The models predict tumor-killing pharmacodynamics in patients and reveal trajectories of tumor evolution across anatomical sites under BiTE immunotherapy. Our models highlight the bone marrow as a potential sanctuary site permitting tumor evolution and antigen escape. The models also suggest that optimal dosing regimens are a function of tumor growth, CD19 expression, and patient T cell abundance, which confer adequate tumor control with reduced disease evolution.

	abstract = {The human immune system consists of a highly intelligent network of billions of independent, self-organized cells that interact with each other. Machine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that automatically processes huge amounts of image data. Immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancer. Specifically, one such therapy involves engineering immune cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), which combine tumor antigen specificity with immune cell activation in a single receptor. To improve their efficacy and expand their applicability to solid tumors, scientists optimize different CARs with different modifications. However, predicting and ranking the efficacy of different "off-the-shelf" immune products (e.g., CAR or Bispecific T-cell Engager [BiTE]) and selection of clinical responders are challenging in clinical practice. Meanwhile, identifying the optimal CAR construct for a researcher to further develop a potential clinical application is limited by the current, time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive conventional tools used to evaluate efficacy. Particularly, more than 30 years of immunological synapse (IS) research data demonstrate that T cell efficacy is not only controlled by the specificity and avidity of the tumor antigen and T cell interaction, but also it depends on a collective process, involving multiple adhesion and regulatory molecules, as well as tumor microenvironment, spatially and temporally organized at the IS formed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells. The optimal function of cytotoxic lymphocytes (including CTL and NK) depends on IS quality. Recognizing the inadequacy of conventional tools and the importance of IS in immune cell functions, we investigate a new strategy for assessing CAR-T efficacy by quantifying CAR IS quality using the glass-support planar lipid bilayer system combined with ML-based data analysis. Previous studies in our group show that CAR-T IS quality correlates with antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo. However, current manually quantified IS quality data analysis is time-consuming and labor-intensive with low accuracy, reproducibility, and repeatability. In this study, we develop a novel ML-based method to quantify thousands of CAR cell IS images with enhanced accuracy and speed. Specifically, we used artificial neural networks (ANN) to incorporate object detection into segmentation. The proposed ANN model extracts the most useful information to differentiate different IS datasets. The network output is flexible and produces bounding boxes, instance segmentation, contour outlines (borders), intensities of the borders, and segmentations without borders. Based on requirements, one or a combination of this information is used in statistical analysis. The ML-based automated algorithm quantified CAR-T IS data correlates with the clinical responder and non-responder treated with Kappa-CAR-T cells directly from patients. The results suggest that CAR cell IS quality can be used as a potential composite biomarker and correlates with antitumor activities in patients, which is sufficiently discriminative to further test the CAR IS quality as a clinical biomarker to predict response to CAR immunotherapy in cancer. For translational research, the method developed here can also provide guidelines for designing and optimizing numerous CAR constructs for potential clinical development.

	abstract = {We recently conducted a clinical trial of CD22-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in children and adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). While we did observe some transient responses, overall outcomes were inferior to another recent trial of CD22 CAR T cells in ALL performed at the NCI (Fry, T.J. et al. Nat Med, 2018). Intriguingly, these trials used a CAR that employed the same antigen-binding and intracellular signaling domains, and differed only in the length of linker connecting the variable regions of the single chain variable fragment (scFv). Based on these clinical observations, we sought to identify how the scFv linker impacts CAR biology and regulates CAR-driven T cell activity.The University of Pennsylvania's CD22 CAR contained a long 20 amino acid scFv linker ("CAR22-L") while the NCI's CAR had a 5 amino acid linker ("CAR22-S"). We began by investigating the impact of linker length on CAR biochemistry. Both CAR22-L and CAR22-S had similar antigen-binding affinities (KD of 1.67nM and 6.05nM, respectively). Chromatography revealed that CAR22-L remained monomeric in solution while CAR22-S formed homodimers. To explore how dimerization influenced surface-membrane biology, we developed GFP-tagged versions of each CAR and performed confocal microscopy on CAR+ T cells. CAR22-L exhibited homogenous surface membrane expression, while CAR22-S appeared to self-aggregate and cluster (Fig. 1a). We investigated the impact of this clustering on receptor signaling and found that CAR22-S demonstrated high levels of signaling molecule activation (i.e. Akt, p70-S6 and STAT3) in the absence of antigen engagement. This is consistent with previous reports establishing that CAR clustering can lead to tonic signaling (Long, A.H. et al. Nat Med, 2015). Importantly, this tonic signaling did not lead to autonomous T cell proliferation.We proceeded to evaluate how clustering and tonic signaling impacted CAR function upon antigen engagement. Microscopic evaluation of CAR T cells combined with CD22+ Nalm6 cells revealed greater actin and microtubule organizing complex polarization (P = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively) in CAR22-S cells, consistent with superior immune synapse formation. This was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of PI3K, MAPK and calcium signaling proteins (Fig. 1b) after CAR engagement. RNA sequencing revealed significantly greater activation of immune response gene programs in CAR22-S cells as compared to CAR22-L after overnight exposure to Nalm6.We next investigated the impact that this enhanced receptor-driven activity had on CAR T cell anti-tumor function. CAR T cells were combined with Nalm6 in vitro and residual Nalm6 was serially quantified, revealing that CAR22-S mediated greater tumor control than CAR22-L, particularly at later time periods (P \&lt; 0.001). This was associated with greater secretion of IFNg, IL-2 and TNFa (all P \&lt; 0.001). Finally, we compared anti-tumor efficacy in xenograft models of systemic Nalm6. NOD/SCID/cg-/- mice were engrafted with Nalm6 and received 1x106 CAR T cells 7 days later. CAR22-S demonstrated greater in vivo expansion (P \&lt; 0.0001) and enhanced control of systemic disease (Fig. 1c,P = 0.017), resulting in prolongation of animal survival (Fig. 1d,P = 0.013). Based on these observations, we have designed a novel, affinity-enhanced CD22 CAR and confirmed that shorter linker length improves anti-tumor activity of this CAR. T cells expressing this CAR are currently undergoing evaluation in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.org Identifiers NCT03620058 and NCT02650414). Thus far, 4 children and 2 adults have been infused with manageable toxicity. Early outcomes are promising, with 67\% achieving complete remission at day 28, compared to 50\% in our original CART22 trials.In summary, by investigating the potential mechanisms for an apparent discrepancy in outcomes between two different clinical trials, we demonstrate that reducing the length of the scFv linker results in significant changes to CAR biochemistry that directly lead to antigen-independent receptor activity. In contrast to previously published data demonstrating that tonic signaling of CD28-costimulated CARs is detrimental to T cell function (Long, A.H. et al. Nat Med, 2015), we found that tonic signaling of 4-1BB-costimulated CARs may be beneficial, possibly by priming T cells for rapid response to antigen.Singh:University of Pennsylvania: Patents \&amp; Royalties.

	abstract = {As the targets of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)–T cells expand to a variety of cancers, autoimmune diseases, viral infections, and fibrosis, there is an increasing demand for identifying new antigens and designing new CARs that can be effectively activated. However, the rational selection of antigens and the design of CARs are limited by a lack of knowledge regarding the molecular mechanism by which CARs are activated by antigens. Here, we present data supporting a “size exclusion” model explaining how antigen signals are transmitted across the plasma membrane to activate the intracellular domains of CARs. In this model, antigen engagement with CAR results in a narrow intermembrane space that physically excludes CD45, a bulky phosphatase, out of the CAR zone, thus favoring CAR phosphorylation by kinases, which further triggers downstream pathways leading to T cell activation. Aligned with this model, increasing the size of CAR extracellular domains diminished CAR-T activation both in vitro and in a mouse lymphoma model; membrane-proximal epitopes activated CAR-Ts better than membrane-distal epitopes. Moreover, increasing the size of CD45 by antibody conjugation enhanced the activation of CARs that recognize membrane-distal epitopes. Consistently, CAR-Ts expressing CD45RABC, the larger isoform, were activated to a higher level than those expressing a smaller isoform CD45RO. Together, our work revealed that CAR-T activation depends on the size difference between the CAR-antigen pair and CD45; the size of CAR, antigen, and CD45 can thus be targets for tuning CAR-T activation.},

For large-scale data, as it for example appears in 3D medical imaging, the U-Net however has prohibitive memory requirements.

This allows us to train deeper and larger networks in practice, under the same GPU memory restrictions.

	abstract = {We propose a deep learning framework for modeling complex high-dimensional densities called Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE). It is based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a distribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear deterministic transformation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent space so as to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution, i.e., resulting in independent latent variables. We parametrize this transformation so that computing the Jacobian determinant and inverse transform is trivial, yet we maintain the ability to learn complex non-linear transformations, via a composition of simple building blocks, each based on a deep neural network. The training criterion is simply the exact log-likelihood, which is tractable. Unbiased ancestral sampling is also easy. We show that this approach yields good generative models on four image datasets and can be used for inpainting.},

	abstract = {Vision Transformers (ViTs) and their multi-scale and hierarchical variations have been successful at capturing image representations but their use has been generally studied for low-resolution images (e.g. - 256x256, 384384). For gigapixel whole-slide imaging (WSI) in computational pathology, WSIs can be as large as 150000x150000 pixels at 20X magnification and exhibit a hierarchical structure of visual tokens across varying resolutions: from 16x16 images capture spatial patterns among cells, to 4096x4096 images characterizing interactions within the tissue microenvironment. We introduce a new ViT architecture called the Hierarchical Image Pyramid Transformer (HIPT), which leverages the natural hierarchical structure inherent in WSIs using two levels of self-supervised learning to learn high-resolution image representations. HIPT is pretrained across 33 cancer types using 10,678 gigapixel WSIs, 408,218 4096x4096 images, and 104M 256x256 images. We benchmark HIPT representations on 9 slide-level tasks, and demonstrate that: 1) HIPT with hierarchical pretraining outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for cancer subtyping and survival prediction, 2) self-supervised ViTs are able to model important inductive biases about the hierarchical structure of phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment.},

Sample clustering alongside correlative assessment revealed variation in the ability of each signature to cluster samples according to patient-of-origin rather than region-of-origin within the multi-region dataset. Signatures focused on cancer-cell intrinsic gene expression were found to produce more clinically useful, patient-centred classifiers, as exemplified by the CRC intrinsic signature (CRIS), which robustly clustered samples by patient-of-origin rather than region-of-origin. These findings highlight the potential of cancer-cell intrinsic signatures to reliably stratify CRC patients by minimising the confounding effects of stromal-derived ITH.},

Benchmarking on two held-out sets (provided by Schrödinger and Merck) containing over 460 ligands and 16 targets, PBCNet demonstrated substantial advantages in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Equipped with a fine-tuning operation, the performance of PBCNet reaches that of Schrödinger’s FEP+, which is much more computationally intensive and requires substantial expert intervention. A further simulation-based experiment showed that active learning-optimized PBCNet may accelerate lead optimization campaigns by 473\%. Finally, for the convenience of users, a web service for PBCNet is established to facilitate complex relative binding affinity prediction through an easy-to-operate graphical interface.},

By combining scRNA-seq analysis of whole skin-derived irradiated cells with genetic ablation and molecular inhibition studies, we show that senescence-associated IL-6 and IL-1 signaling, together with IL-17 upregulation and CCR6+-mediated immune cell migration, are crucial drivers of IRIAD. Bioinformatics analysis colocalized irradiation-induced IL-6 signaling with senescence pathway upregulation largely within epidermal hair follicles, basal keratinocytes, and dermal fibroblasts. Loss of cytokine signaling by genetic ablation in IL-6?/? or IL-1R?/? mice, or by molecular blockade, strongly ameliorated IRIAD, as did deficiency of CCL20/CCR6-mediated immune cell migration in CCR6?/? mice. Moreover, IL-6 deficiency strongly reduced IL-17, IL-22, CCL20, and CCR6 upregulation, whereas CCR6 deficiency reciprocally diminished IL-6, IL-17, CCL3, and MHC upregulation, suggesting that proximity-dependent cellular cross talk promotes IRIAD. Therapeutically, topical application of Janus kinase blockers or inhibition of T-cell activation by cyclosporine effectively reduced IRIAD, suggesting the potential of targeted approaches for the treatment of dermal side effects in radiotherapy patients.},

The structure was solved at 2.7 Å in association with a competitive peptide inhibitor of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)–uPAR interaction. uPAR is composed of three consecutive three-finger domains organized in an almost circular manner, which generates both a deep internal cavity where the peptide binds in a helical conformation, and a large external surface. This knowledge combined with the discovery of a convergent binding motif shared by the antagonist peptide and uPA allowed us to build a model of the human uPA–uPAR complex. This model reveals that the receptor-binding module of uPA engages the uPAR central cavity, thus leaving the external receptor surface accessible for other protein interactions (vitronectin and integrins). By this unique structural assembly, uPAR can orchestrate the fine interplay with the partners that are required to guide uPA-focalized proteolysis on the cell surface and control cell adhesion and migration.},

	abstract = {The role of the urokinase receptor (uPAR) in the internalization of the urokinase-plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (uPA.PAI-1) complex has been investigated. First, exploiting the species specificity of uPA binding, we show that mouse LB6 cells (that express a mouse uPAR) were unable to bind or degrade the human uPA.PAI-1 complex. On the other hand, LB6 clone 19 cells, which express a transfected human uPAR, degraded uPA.PAI-1 complexes with kinetics identical to the human monocytic U937 cells. We also show by immunofluorescence experiments with anti-uPA antibodies that in LB6 clone 19 cells, the uPA.PAI-1 complex is indeed internalized. While at 4 degrees C uPA fluorescence was visible at the cell surface, shift of the temperature to 37 degrees C caused a displacement of the immunoreactivity to the cytoplasmic compartment, with a pattern indicating lysosomal localization. If uPA.PAI-1 internalization/degradation is mediated by uPAR, inhibition of uPA.PAI-1 binding to uPAR should block degradation. Three different treatments, competition with the agonist amino-terminal fragment of uPA, treatment with a monoclonal antibody directed toward the binding domain of uPAR or release of uPAR from the cell surface with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C completely prevented uPA.PAI-1 degradation. The possibility that a serpin-enzyme complex receptor might be primarily or secondarily involved in the internalization process was excluded since a serpin-enzyme complex peptide failed to inhibit uPA.PAI-1 binding and degradation. Similarly, complexes of PAI-1 with low molecular mass uPA (33 kDa uPA), which lacks the uPAR binding domain, were neither bound nor degraded. Finally we also show that treatment of cells with uPA.PAI-1 complex caused a specific but partial down-regulation of uPAR. A similar result was obtained when PAI-1 was allowed to complex to uPA that had been previously bound to the receptor. The possibility therefore exists that the entire complex uPA.PAI-1-uPAR is internalized. All these data allow us to conclude that internalization of the uPA.PAI-1 complex is mediated by uPAR.},

Multiple factors can contribute to ageing-associated inflammation2; however, the molecular pathways that transduce aberrant inflammatory signalling and their impact in natural ageing remain unclear. Here we show that the cGAS–STING signalling pathway, which mediates immune sensing of DNA3, is a critical driver of chronic inflammation and functional decline during ageing. Blockade of STING suppresses the inflammatory phenotypes of senescent human cells and tissues, attenuates ageing-related inflammation in multiple peripheral organs and the brain in mice, and leads to an improvement in tissue function. Focusing on the ageing brain, we reveal that activation of STING triggers reactive microglial transcriptional states, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Cytosolic DNA released from perturbed mitochondria elicits cGAS activity in old microglia, defining a mechanism by which cGAS–STING signalling is engaged in the ageing brain. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of microglia and hippocampi of a cGAS gain-of-function mouse model demonstrates that engagement of cGAS in microglia is sufficient to direct ageing-associated transcriptional microglial states leading to bystander cell inflammation, neurotoxicity and impaired memory capacity. Our findings establish the cGAS–STING pathway as a driver of ageing-related inflammation in peripheral organs and the brain, and reveal blockade of cGAS–STING signalling as a potential strategy to halt neurodegenerative processes during old age.},

State-of-the-art design protocols now achieve experimental success rates nearing 20\%, thus widening the access to de novo designed proteins. Despite extensive progress, there are clear field-wide challenges, for example in determining the best in silico metrics to prioritise designs for experimental testing, and in designing proteins that can undergo large conformational changes or be regulated by post-translational modifications and other cellular processes. With an increase in the number of models being developed, this review provides a framework to understand how these tools fit into the overall process of de novo protein design.

This work shows that existing pretraining methods, especially self-supervised methods, can produce such features if trained on enough curated data from diverse sources. We revisit existing approaches and combine different techniques to scale our pretraining in terms of data and model size. Most of the technical contributions aim at accelerating and stabilizing the training at scale. In terms of data, we propose an automatic pipeline to build a dedicated, diverse, and curated image dataset instead of uncurated data, as typically done in the self-supervised literature.

The high polymorphism of MHC-II genes represents an important hurdle towards accurate prediction and identification of CD4+ T-cell epitopes in different individuals and different species. Here we collected and curated a dataset of 627,013 unique MHC-II ligands identified by mass spectrometry. This enabled us to precisely determine the binding motifs of 88 MHC-II alleles across human, mouse, cattle and chicken. Analysis of these binding specificities combined with X-ray crystallography refined our understanding of the molecular determinants of MHC-II motifs and revealed a widespread reverse binding mode in MHC-II ligands. We then developed a machine learning framework to accurately predict binding specificities and ligands of any MHC-II allele. This tool improves and expands predictions of CD4+ T-cell epitopes, and enabled us to discover and characterize several viral and bacterial epitopes following the aforementioned reverse binding mode.},

However, the rules that govern which peptides are truly recognized by existing T cell receptors (TCRs) remain poorly understood, precluding accurate predictions of neo-epitopes for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we capitalize on recent (neo-)epitope data to train a predictor of immunogenic epitopes (PRIME), which captures molecular properties of both antigen presentation and TCR recognition. PRIME not only improves prioritization of neo-epitopes but also correlates with T cell potency and unravels biophysical determinants of TCR recognition that we experimentally validate. Analysis of cancer genomics data reveals that recurrent mutations tend to be less frequent in patients where they are predicted to be immunogenic, providing further evidence for immunoediting in human cancer. PRIME will facilitate identiﬁcation of pathogen epitopes in infectious diseases and neo-epitopes in cancer immunotherapy.},

Nonetheless, several trials have revealed pre-existing and/or treatment-induced immune responses to the mouse-derived single-chain variable fragments included in these constructs. These responses might have contributed to both treatment failure and the limited success of redosing strategies observed in some patients. Data from early phase clinical trials suggest that CAR T cells are also associated with immunogenicity-related events in patients with solid tumours. Generally, the clinical implications of anti-CAR immune responses are poorly understood and highly variable between different CAR constructs and malignancies. These observations highlight an urgent need to uncover the mechanisms of immunogenicity in patients receiving CAR T cells and develop validated assays to enable clinical detection. In this Review, we describe the current clinical evidence of anti-CAR immune responses and discuss how new CAR T cell technologies might impact the risk of immunogenicity. We then suggest ways to reduce the risks of anti-CAR immune responses to CAR T cell products that are advancing towards the clinic. Finally, we summarize measures that investigators could consider in order to systematically monitor and better comprehend the possible effects of immunogenicity during trials involving CAR T cells as well as in routine clinical practice.},

In preclinical models, we have previously shown that transfection of T cells with mRNA coding for a CAR is an alternative strategy that has antitumor efficacy and the potential to evaluate the on-target off-tumor toxicity of new CAR targets safely due to transient mRNA CAR expression. Here, we report the safety observed in four patients treated with autologous T cells that had been electroporated with mRNA coding for a CAR derived from a murine antibody to human mesothelin. Because of the transient nature of CAR expression on the T cells, subjects in the clinical study were given repeated infusions of the CAR-T cells to assess their safety. One subject developed anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest within minutes of completing the third infusion. Although human anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies have been known to develop with CAR-transduced T cells, they have been thought to have no adverse clinical consequences. This is the first description of clinical anaphylaxis resulting from CAR-modified T cells, most likely through IgE antibodies specific to the CAR. These results indicate that the potential immunogenicity of CARs derived from murine antibodies may be a safety issue for mRNA CARs, especially when administered using an intermittent dosing schedule.

The analysis of humoral immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies) against CARs could be performed with a bridging ELISA, using labeled CAR fragments. However, outside of its native cell membrane environment and without potential interaction partners on the cell surface, a labeled or coated recombinant CAR fragment may structurally differ from the membrane-bound CAR expressed on CAR-T cells. Consequently, immunogenicity to CARs may be missed due to the artificial nature of a ligand binding assay setup. T-cell lines expressing the CAR offer the opportunity to measure anti-drug antibodies to the CAR in its natural cell environment, as an alternative to ligand-binding assays. Here we describe a novel, flow cytometry-based humoral immunogenicity assay for tisagenlecleucel (CTL019, Kymriah®) using a human T-cell line that expresses murine CAR19. The assay described here was fully validated according to health authority guidelines for the development and validation of immunogenicity assays and has a sensitivity of 100 ng/mL. A good correlation of screening assay signal strengths to titer assay results was observed while exploring options to increase titration assay throughput. Pre-existing antibodies against the cell line used in the assay as well as against the CAR itself complicate the assay and data interpretation.},

A Nanobody differs from a human heavy chain variable domain in about ten amino acids spread all over its surface, four hallmark Nanobody-specific amino acids in the framework-2 region (positions 42, 49, 50, and 52), and a longer third antigen-binding loop (H3) folding over this area. For therapeutic applications the camelid-specific amino acid sequences in the framework have to be mutated to their human heavy chain variable domain equivalent, i.e. humanized. We performed this humanization exercise with Nanobodies of the subfamily that represents close to 80\% of all dromedary-derived Nanobodies and investigated the effects on antigen affinity, solubility, expression yield, and stability. It is demonstrated that the humanization of Nanobody-specific residues outside framework-2 are neutral to the Nanobody properties. Surprisingly, the Glu-49 --{\textgreater} Gly and Arg-50 --{\textgreater} Leu humanization of hallmark amino acids generates a single domain that is more stable though probably less soluble. The other framework-2 substitutions, Phe-42 --{\textgreater} Val and Gly/Ala-52 --{\textgreater} Trp, are detrimental for antigen affinity, due to a repositioning of the H3 loop as shown by their crystal structures. These insights were used to identify a soluble, stable, well expressed universal humanized Nanobody scaffold that allows grafts of antigen-binding loops from other Nanobodies with transfer of the antigen specificity and affinity.},

To highlight the value of the noncovalent complex in the covalent binding process, here we describe a new protocol using tethered and constrained docking in combination with Dynamic Undocking (DUck) as a tool to privilege strong protein binders for the identification of novel covalent inhibitors. At the end of the protocol, dedicated covalent docking methods were used to rank and select the virtual hits based on the predicted binding mode. By validating the method on JAK3 and KRas, we demonstrate how this fast iterative protocol can be applied to explore a wide chemical space and identify potent targeted covalent inhibitors.},

Diffusion models10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence–structure relationships.

We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.},

	abstract = {The Information Bottleneck (IB) objective uses information theory to formulate a task-performance versus robustness trade-off. It has been successfully applied in the standard discriminative classification setting. We pose the question whether the IB can also be used to train generative likelihood models such as normalizing flows. Since normalizing flows use invertible network architectures (INNs), they are information-preserving by construction. This seems contradictory to the idea of a bottleneck. In this work, firstly, we develop the theory and methodology of IB-INNs, a class of conditional normalizing flows where INNs are trained using the IB objective: Introducing a small amount of controlled information loss allows for an asymptotically exact formulation of the IB, while keeping the INN's generative capabilities intact. Secondly, we investigate the properties of these models experimentally, specifically used as generative classifiers. This model class offers advantages such as improved uncertainty quantification and out-of-distribution detection, but traditional generative classifier solutions suffer considerably in classification accuracy. We find the trade-off parameter in the IB controls a mix of generative capabilities and accuracy close to standard classifiers. Empirically, our uncertainty estimates in this mixed regime compare favourably to conventional generative and discriminative classifiers. Code is provided in the supplement.},

	abstract = {The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) governs several signaling pathways for cell proliferation, survival, and anti-apoptosis. Thus, targeting IGF-1R appears as a reasonable rationale for tumor treatment. However, clinical studies showed that inhibition of IGF-1R has very limited efficacy due to the development of resistance to IGF-1R blockade in tumor cells. Here, we discovered that prolonged treatment of colon cancer cells with IGF-1R inhibitors (BMS-754807 and GSK1838705A) stimulates p70 KDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) activation, a well-known kinase signaling for cell survival. We also found that p70S6K1 activation by IGF-1R inhibition is independent of K-Ras and PIK3CA mutations that frequently occur in colon cancer. Besides the increased p70S6K1 phosphorylation, the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2) was elevated in the cells treated with BMS-754807. Interestingly, the increases in MEK1/2 and p70S6K1 phosphorylation were also observed when cells were subjected to the treatment of AKT inhibitor or genetic knockdown of AKT2 but not AKT1, suggesting that AKT2 inhibition stimulates MEK1/2 phosphorylation to activate p70S6K1. Conversely, inhibition of MEK1/2 by MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) or knockdown of MEK1 and MEK2 by corresponding mek1 and mek2 siRNA enhanced AKT phosphorylation, indicating mutual inhibition between AKT and MEK. Furthermore, the combination of BMS-754807 and U0126 efficiently decreased the cell viability and increased cleaved caspase 3 and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that the treatment of colon tumor cells with IGF-1R inhibitors stimulates p70S6K1 activity via MEK1/2 to promote survival, providing a new strategy for colorectal cancer therapeutics.},

This group of CRC patients, characterized by the worst prognosis, has been extensively investigated to improve their life expectancy. Main efforts, focused on the epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR), which plays a pivotal role in CRC pathogenesis, have led to the development and introduction in clinical practice of specific targeted therapies (ie, monoclonal antibodies). Subsequently, the scientific community has tried to identify molecular predictors of the efficacy of such therapies. However, it has become clear that EGFR alterations occurring in CRC are difficult to investigate, and therefore their predictive role is unclear. In contrast, the clinical role of two downstream members (KRAS and NRAS) has been clearly demonstrated. Currently, EGFR-targeted therapies can be administered only to patients with wild-type KRAS and NRAS genes. Our review addresses the medical management of metastatic CRC. Specifically, we describe in detail the molecular biology of metastatic CRC, focusing on the EGFR signaling pathway, and we discuss the role of current and emerging related biomarkers and therapies in this field. We also summarize the clinical evidence regarding anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies and examine potential future perspectives.

We identify pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) as an important direct target within a larger gene program for metabolism. PDK1 inhibits pyruvate flux to mitochondrial respiration and a rescue of its expression in Wnt-inhibited cancer cells rescues glycolysis as well as vessel growth in the tumor microenvironment. Thus, we identify an important mechanism by which Wnt-driven Warburg metabolism directs the use of glucose for cancer cell proliferation and links it to vessel delivery of oxygen and nutrients.},

NSC lineage commitment in 3D is maximally stiffness sensitive in the range of 0.1 to 1.2 kPa, a narrower and more brain-mimetic range than we had previously identified in 2D (0.75 to 75 kPa). Transcriptomics revealed stiffness-dependent up-regulation of early growth response 1 (Egr1) in 3D but not in 2D. Egr1 knockdown enhanced neurogenesis in stiff ECMs by driving β-catenin nuclear localization and activity in 3D, but not in 2D. Mechanical modeling and experimental studies under osmotic pressure indicate that stiff 3D ECMs are likely to stimulate Egr1 via increases in confining stress during cell volumetric growth.

	abstract = {Purpose

To date, evidence for tissue epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression as a biomarker for anti-EGFR therapies has been weak. We investigated the genomic landscape of EGFR amplification in blood-derived cell-free tumor DNA (cfDNA) across diverse cancers and the role of anti-EGFR therapies in achieving response.

Methods

We assessed EGFR amplification status among 28,584 patients with malignancies evaluated by clinical-grade next-generation sequencing (NGS) of blood-derived cfDNA (54- to 73-gene panel). Furthermore, we curated the clinical characteristics of 1,434 patients at the University of California San Diego who had cfDNA testing by this NGS test.

Results

Overall, EGFR amplification was detected in cfDNA from 8.5\% of patients (2,423 of 28,584), most commonly in colorectal (16.3\% [458 of 2,807]), non–small-cell lung (9.0\% [1,096 of 12,197]), and genitourinary cancers (8.1\% [170 of 2,104]). Most patients had genomic coalterations (96.9\% [95 of 98]), frequently involving genes affecting other tyrosine kinases (72.4\% [71 of 98]), mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (56.1\% [55 of 98]), cell-cycle–associated signals (52.0\% [51 of 98]), and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway (35.7\% [35 of 98]). EGFR amplification emerged in serial cfDNA after various anticancer therapies (n = 6), including checkpoint inhibitors (n = 4), suggesting a possible role for these amplifications in acquired resistance. Nine evaluable patients with EGFR amplification were treated with anti-EGFR–based regimens; five (55.6\%) achieved partial responses, including three patients whose tissue NGS lacked EGFR amplification.

Conclusion

EGFR amplification was detected in cfDNA among 8.5\% of 28,584 diverse cancers. Most patients had coexisting alterations. Responses were observed in five of nine patients who received EGFR inhibitors. Incorporating EGFR inhibitors into the treatment regimens of patients harboring EGFR amplification in cfDNA merits additional study.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a hemorrhagic stroke disease affecting up to 0.5\% of North Americans that has no approved nonsurgical treatment. A subset of patients have a hereditary form of the disease due primarily to loss-of-function mutations in KRIT1, CCM2, or PDCD10. We sought to identify known drugs that could be repurposed to treat CCM.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed an unbiased screening platform based on both cellular and animal models of loss of function of CCM2. Our discovery strategy consisted of 4 steps: an automated immunofluorescence and machine-learning-based primary screen of structural phenotypes in human endothelial cells deficient in CCM2, a secondary screen of functional changes in endothelial stability in these same cells, a rapid in vivo tertiary screen of dermal microvascular leak in mice lacking endothelial Ccm2, and finally a quaternary screen of CCM lesion burden in these same mice. We screened 2100 known drugs and bioactive compounds and identified 2 candidates, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and tempol (a scavenger of superoxide), for further study. Each drug decreased lesion burden in a mouse model of CCM vascular disease by ≈50\%.
CONCLUSIONS: By identifying known drugs as potential therapeutics for CCM, we have decreased the time, cost, and risk of bringing treatments to patients. Each drug also prompts additional exploration of biomarkers of CCM disease. We further suggest that the structure-function screening platform presented here may be adapted and scaled to facilitate drug discovery for diverse loss-of-function genetic vascular disease.},

	volume = {19},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Results from clinical trials involving resistance to molecularly targeted therapies have revealed the importance of rational single-agent and combination treatment strategies. In this study, we tested the efficacy of a type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R)/insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, OSI-906, in combination with a mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-ERK kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor based on evidence that the MAP kinase pathway was upregulated in colorectal cancer cell lines that were resistant to OSI-906.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The antiproliferative effects of OSI-906 and the MEK 1/2 inhibitor U0126 were analyzed both as single agents and in combination in 13 colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro. Apoptosis, downstream effector proteins, and cell cycle were also assessed. In addition, the efficacy of OSI-906 combined with the MEK 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) was evaluated in vivo using human colorectal cancer xenograft models.
RESULTS: The combination of OSI-906 and U0126 resulted in synergistic effects in 11 of 13 colorectal cancer cell lines tested. This synergy was variably associated with apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest in addition to molecular effects on prosurvival pathways. The synergy was also reflected in the in vivo xenograft studies following treatment with the combination of OSI-906 and selumetinib.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study demonstrate synergistic antiproliferative effects in response to the combination of OSI-906 with an MEK 1/2 inhibitor in colorectal cancer cell line models both in vitro and in vivo, which supports the rational combination of OSI-906 with an MEK inhibitor in patients with colorectal cancer.

Consequently, its logical therapeutical applications seems to be limited to restore physiological circulating levels in order to recover the clinical consequences of IGF-I deficiency, conditions where, despite continuous discrepancies, IGF-I treatment has never been related to oncogenesis. Currently the best characterized conditions of IGF-I deficiency are Laron Syndrome, in children; liver cirrhosis, in adults; aging including age-related-cardiovascular and neurological diseases; and more recently, intrauterine growth restriction. The aim of this review is to summarize the increasing list of roles of IGF-I, both in physiological and pathological conditions, underlying that its potential therapeutical options seem to be limited to those proven states of local or systemic IGF-I deficiency as a replacement treatment, rather than increasing its level upper the normal range.},

Some examples are mass extinctions within ecosystems, cascading failures in infrastructure systems, and changes in human and animal social networks. The ability to avoid such regime shifts or to recover quickly from such a non-resilient state demonstrates a system’s resilience; system resilience is a quality that enables a system to adjust its activities to retain its basic functionality when errors and failures occur. In the past 50 years, attention has been paid almost exclusively to low-dimensional systems; scholars have focused on the calibration of the resilience functions of such systems and the identification of indicators of early warning signals based on two to three connected components. In recent years, taking advantage of network theory and the availability of lavish real datasets, network scientists have begun to explore real-world complex networked multidimensional systems, as well as their resilience functions and early warning indicators. This report presents a comprehensive review of resilience functions and regime shifts in complex systems in domains such as ecology, biology, society, and infrastructure. The research approach includes empirical observations, experimental studies, mathematical modeling, and theoretical analysis. We also review the definitions of some ambiguous terms, including robustness, resilience, and stability.},

Notably, the extent of cooperativity distinguishes molecular glues from bifunctional compounds, which constitute a second class of inducers of protein–protein interactions. However, apart from serendipitous discovery, there have been limited rational screening strategies for the high cooperativity exhibited by molecular glues. Here, we propose a binding-based screen of DNA-barcoded compounds on a target protein in the presence or absence of a presenter protein, using the “presenter ratio”, the ratio of ternary enrichment to binary enrichment, as a predictive measure of cooperativity. Through this approach, we identified a range of cooperative, noncooperative, and uncooperative compounds in a single DNA-encoded library screen with bromodomain containing protein (BRD)9 and the VHL–elongin C–elongin B (VCB) complex. Our most cooperative hit compound, 13-7, exhibits micromolar binding affinity to BRD9 but nanomolar affinity for the ternary complex with BRD9 and VCB, with cooperativity comparable to classical molecular glues. This approach may enable the rational discovery of molecular glues for preselected proteins and thus facilitate the transition to a new paradigm of small-molecule therapeutics.},

In agreement with our earlier investigation using GROMACS 4.6 on hardware of 2014, the performance to price ratio of consumer GPU nodes is considerably higher than that of CPU nodes. However, with GROMACS 2018, the optimal CPU to GPU processing power balance has shifted even more toward the GPU. Hence, nodes optimized for GROMACS 2018 and later versions enable a significantly higher performance to price ratio than nodes optimized for older GROMACS versions. Moreover, the shift toward GPU processing allows to cheaply upgrade old nodes with recent GPUs, yielding essentially the same performance as comparable brand‐new hardware. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {We present a novel generative modeling method called diffusion normalizing flow based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The algorithm consists of two neural SDEs: a forward SDE that gradually adds noise to the data to transform the data into Gaussian random noise, and a backward SDE that gradually removes the noise to sample from the data distribution. By jointly training the two neural SDEs to minimize a common cost function that quantifies the difference between the two, the backward SDE converges to a diffusion process the starts with a Gaussian distribution and ends with the desired data distribution. Our method is closely related to normalizing flow and diffusion probabilistic models, and can be viewed as a combination of the two. Compared with normalizing flow, diffusion normalizing flow is able to learn distributions with sharp boundaries. Compared with diffusion probabilistic models, diffusion normalizing flow requires fewer discretization steps and thus has better sampling efficiency. Our algorithm demonstrates competitive performance in both high-dimension data density estimation and image generation tasks.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a widely used technique to simulate molecular systems, most commonly at the all-atom resolution where the equations of motion are integrated with timesteps on the order of femtoseconds (\$1{\textbackslash}textrm\{fs\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}{\textbackslash}textrm\{s\}\$). MD is often used to compute equilibrium properties, which requires sampling from an equilibrium distribution such as the Boltzmann distribution. However, many important processes, such as binding and folding, occur over timescales of milliseconds or beyond, and cannot be efficiently sampled with conventional MD. Furthermore, new MD simulations need to be performed from scratch for each molecular system studied. We present Timewarp, an enhanced sampling method which uses a normalising flow as a proposal distribution in a Markov chain Monte Carlo method targeting the Boltzmann distribution. The flow is trained offline on MD trajectories and learns to make large steps in time, simulating the molecular dynamics of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{5\} - 10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}{\textbackslash}:{\textbackslash}textrm\{fs\}\$. Crucially, Timewarp is transferable between molecular systems: once trained, we show that it generalises to unseen small peptides (2-4 amino acids), exploring their metastable states and providing wall-clock acceleration when sampling compared to standard MD. Our method constitutes an important step towards developing general, transferable algorithms for accelerating MD.},

	abstract = {Normalizing flows are a class of deep generative models that are especially interesting for modeling probability distributions in physics, where the exact likelihood of flows allows reweighting to known target energy functions and computing unbiased observables. For instance, Boltzmann generators tackle the long-standing sampling problem in statistical physics by training flows to produce equilibrium samples of many-body systems such as small molecules and proteins. To build effective models for such systems, it is crucial to incorporate the symmetries of the target energy into the model, which can be achieved by equivariant continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). However, CNFs can be computationally expensive to train and generate samples from, which has hampered their scalability and practical application. In this paper, we introduce equivariant flow matching, a new training objective for equivariant CNFs that is based on the recently proposed optimal transport flow matching. Equivariant flow matching exploits the physical symmetries of the target energy for efficient, simulation-free training of equivariant CNFs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on many-particle systems and a small molecule, alanine dipeptide, where for the first time we obtain a Boltzmann generator with significant sampling efficiency without relying on tailored internal coordinate featurization. Our results show that the equivariant flow matching objective yields flows with shorter integration paths, improved sampling efficiency, and higher scalability compared to existing methods.},

Being an importance sampling based estimator, however, FEP suffers from a severe limitation: the requirement of sufficient overlap between distributions. One strategy to mitigate this problem, called Targeted Free Energy Perturbation, uses a high-dimensional mapping in configuration space to increase overlap of the underlying distributions. Despite its potential, this method has attracted only limited attention due to the formidable challenge of formulating a tractable mapping. Here, we cast Targeted FEP as a machine learning problem in which the mapping is parameterized as a neural network that is optimized so as to increase overlap. We develop a new model architecture that respects permutational and periodic symmetries often encountered in atomistic simulations and test our method on a fully-periodic solvation system. We demonstrate that our method leads to a substantial variance reduction in free energy estimates when compared against baselines, without requiring any additional data.},

	abstract = {Normalizing flows provide a general mechanism for defining expressive probability distributions, only requiring the specification of a (usually simple) base distribution and a series of bijective transformations. There has been much recent work on normalizing flows, ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the field has now matured and is in need of a unified perspective. In this review, we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing flows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of flow design, and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-offs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of flows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly, we summarize the use of flows for tasks such as generative modeling, approximate inference, and supervised learning.},

In LREX, a normalizing flow is trained to map the configurations of the fastest-mixing replica into configurations belonging to the target distribution, allowing direct exchanges between the two without the need to simulate intermediate replicas. This can significantly reduce the computational cost compared to standard replica exchange. The proposed method also offers several advantages with respect to Boltzmann generators that directly use normalizing flows to sample the target distribution.

Recent work showed that such generative models can be utilized in statistical mechanics to sample equilibrium states of many-body systems in physics and chemistry. To scale and generalize these results, it is essential that the natural symmetries in the probability density – in physics defined by the invariances of the target potential – are built into the flow. We provide a theoretical sufficient criterion showing that the distribution generated by equivariant normalizing flows is invariant with respect to these symmetries by design. Furthermore, we propose building blocks for flows which preserve symmetries which are usually found in physical/chemical many-body particle systems. Using benchmark systems motivated from molecular physics, we demonstrate that those symmetry preserving flows can provide better generalization capabilities and sampling efficiency.},

While classical stochastic sampling methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Langevin Dynamics (LD) can suffer from slow mixing times there is a growing interest in using normalizing flows in order to learn the transformation of a simple prior distribution to the given target distribution. Here we propose a generalized and combined approach to sample target densities: Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF) -- an arbitrary sequence of deterministic invertible functions and stochastic sampling blocks. We show that stochasticity overcomes expressivity limitations of normalizing flows resulting from the invertibility constraint, whereas trainable transformations between sampling steps improve efficiency of pure MCMC/LD along the flow. By invoking ideas from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics we derive an efficient training procedure by which both the sampler's and the flow's parameters can be optimized end-to-end, and by which we can compute exact importance weights without having to marginalize out the randomness of the stochastic blocks. We illustrate the representational power, sampling efficiency and asymptotic correctness of SNFs on several benchmarks including applications to sampling molecular systems in equilibrium.},

Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.},

Specifically, we present the notion of Flow Matching (FM), a simulation-free approach for training CNFs based on regressing vector fields of fixed conditional probability paths. Flow Matching is compatible with a general family of Gaussian probability paths for transforming between noise and data samples—which subsumes existing diffusion paths as specific instances. Interestingly, we find that employing FM with diffusion paths results in a more robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow Matching opens the door to training CNFs with other, non-diffusion probability paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport (OT) displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths. These paths are more efficient than diffusion paths, provide faster training and sampling, and result in better generalization. Training CNFs using Flow Matching on ImageNet leads to consistently better performance than alternative diffusion-based methods in terms of both likelihood and sample quality, and allows fast and reliable sample generation using off-the-shelf numerical ODE solvers.},

Riemannian Flow Matching bypasses these limitations and offers several advantages over previous approaches: it is simulation-free on simple geometries, does not require divergence computation, and computes its target vector field in closed-form. The key ingredient behind RFM is the construction of a relatively simple premetric for defining target vector fields, which encompasses the existing Euclidean case. To extend to general geometries, we rely on the use of spectral decompositions to efficiently compute premetrics on the fly.

This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels.

Especially in biocomputing, the significant speedup granted by simplified molecular models opened the possibility of increasing the diversity and complexity of macromolecular systems, providing realistic insights on large assemblies for more extended time windows. However, a holistic view of biological ensembles' structural and dynamic features requires a self-consistent force field, namely, a set of equations and parameters that describe the intra and intermolecular interactions among moieties of diverse chemical nature (i.e., nucleic and amino acids, lipids, solvent, ions, etc.). Nevertheless, examples of such force fields are scarce in the literature at the fully atomistic and coarse-grained levels. Moreover, the number of force fields capable of handling simultaneously different scales is restricted to a handful. Among those, the SIRAH force field, developed in our group, furnishes a set of topologies and tools that facilitate the setting up and running of molecular dynamics simulations at the coarse-grained and multiscale levels. SIRAH uses the same classical pairwise Hamiltonian function implemented in the most popular molecular dynamics software. In particular, it runs natively in AMBER and Gromacs engines, and porting it to other simulation packages is straightforward.

Here we investigate the use of a straight cutoff Lennard-Jones potential with potential modifiers. Together with a Verlet neighbor search algorithm, the modified potential allows the use of GPUs to accelerate the computations in Gromacs. We find that this alternative potential has little influence on most of the properties studied, including partitioning free energies, bulk liquid properties and bilayer properties. At the same time, energy conservation is kept within reasonable bounds.

However, the mechanism of formation and certain structural features of LNP-siRNA remain obscure. These systems are formed from lipid mixtures (cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid) dissolved in ethanol that is rapidly mixed with siRNA in aqueous buffer at a pH (pH 4) where the ionizable lipid is positively charged. The resulting dispersion is then dialyzed against a normal saline buffer to remove residual ethanol and raise the pH to 7.4 (above the pKa of the cationic lipid) to produce the finished LNP-siRNA systems. Here we provide cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and X-ray evidence that the complexes formed between siRNA and ionizable lipid at pH 4 correspond to tightly packed bilayer structures with siRNA sandwiched between closely apposed monolayers. Further, it is shown that ionizable lipid not complexed to siRNA promotes formation of very small vesicular structures at pH 4 that coalesce to form larger LNP structures with amorphous electron dense cores at pH 7.4. A mechanism of formation of LNP-siRNA systems is proposed whereby siRNA is first sandwiched between closely apposed lipid monolayers at pH 4 and subsequently trapped in these structures as the pH is raised to 7.4, whereas ionizable lipid not interacting with siRNA moves from bilayer structure to adopt an amorphous oil phase located in the center of the LNP as the pH is raised. This model is discussed in terms of previous hypotheses and potential relevance to the design of LNP-siRNA systems.},

To function in vivo, mRNA requires safe, effective and stable delivery systems that protect the nucleic acid from degradation and that allow cellular uptake and mRNA release. Lipid nanoparticles have successfully entered the clinic for the delivery of mRNA; in particular, lipid nanoparticle–mRNA vaccines are now in clinical use against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which marks a milestone for mRNA therapeutics. In this Review, we discuss the design of lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery and examine physiological barriers and possible administration routes for lipid nanoparticle–mRNA systems.

Experimental data enable a candidate-based approach to systematically model novel protein assemblies.

We show that crosslinking interactions prior to cell lysis reveals protein interactions that are often lost upon cell lysis. We predict the structures of these protein interactions and others in the SubtiWiki database with AlphaFold-Multimer and, after controlling for the false-positive rate of the predictions, we propose novel structural models of 153 dimeric and 14 trimeric protein assemblies. Crosslinking MS data independently validates the AlphaFold predictions and scoring. We report and validate novel interactors of central cellular machineries that include the ribosome, RNA polymerase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase, assigning function to several uncharacterized proteins. Our approach uncovers protein?protein interactions inside intact cells, provides structural insight into their interaction interfaces, and is applicable to genetically intractable organisms, including pathogenic bacteria.},

We propose here a change in perspective that shifts the focus from the bias to the probability distribution reconstruction while retaining some of the key characteristics of metadynamics, such as flexible on-the-fly adjustments to the free energy estimate. The result is an enhanced sampling method that presents a drastic improvement in convergence speed, especially when dealing with suboptimal and/or multidimensional sets of collective variables. The method is especially robust and easy to use and in fact requires only a few simple parameters to be set, and it has a straightforward reweighting scheme to recover the statistics of the unbiased ensemble. Furthermore, it gives more control of the desired exploration of the phase space since the deposited bias is not allowed to grow indefinitely and it does not push the simulation to uninteresting high free energy regions. We demonstrate the performance of the method in a number of representative examples.},

Activation of the EGFR is linked to changes in the conformation of the transmembrane (TM) domain, brought about by changes in interactions of the TM helices of the membrane lipid bilayer. Using an advanced computational approach that combines Coarse-Grained molecular dynamics and well-tempered MetaDynamics (CG-MetaD), we characterize the large-scale motions of the TM helices, simulating multiple association and dissociation events between the helices in membrane, thus leading to a free energy landscape of the dimerization process. The lowest energy state of the TM domain is a right-handed dimer structure in which the TM helices interact through the N-terminal small-X3-small sequence motif. In addition to this state, which is thought to correspond to the active form of the receptor, we have identified further low-energy states that allow us to integrate with a high level of detail a range of previous experimental observations. These conformations may lead to the active state via two possible activation pathways, which involve pivoting and rotational motions of the helices, respectively. Molecular dynamics also reveals correlation between the conformational changes of the TM domains and of the intracellular juxtamembrane domains, paving the way for a comprehensive understanding of EGFR signaling at the cell membrane.},

In an attempt to achieve balance between speed and accuracy, we have combined rigorous umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulation with a coarse-grained protein model. We predicted the effect of missense variations on binding affinity by selecting three protein–protein systems and comparing results to empirical relative binding affinity values and to non-rigorous modeling approaches. We obtained significant improvement both in our ability to discern stabilizing from destabilizing missense variations and in the correlation between predicted and experimental values compared to non-rigorous approaches.

Here, we demonstrate its application to learn an effective coarse-grained (CG) model from all-atom simulation data in a sample efficient manner. The CG force field is learned by following the thermodynamic consistency principle, here by minimizing the error between the predicted CG force and the all-atom mean force in the CG coordinates. Solving this problem by GDML directly is impossible because coarse-graining requires averaging over many training data points, resulting in impractical memory requirements for storing the kernel matrices. In this work, we propose a data-efficient and memory-saving alternative. Using ensemble learning and stratified sampling, we propose a 2-layer training scheme that enables GDML to learn an effective CG model. We illustrate our method on a simple biomolecular system, alanine dipeptide, by reconstructing the free energy landscape of a CG variant of this molecule. Our novel GDML training scheme yields a smaller free energy error than neural networks when the training set is small, and a comparably high accuracy when the training set is sufficiently large.},

For training, we build a unique dataset of unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of approximately 9 ms for twelve different proteins with multiple secondary structure arrangements. The coarse-grained models are capable of accelerating the dynamics by more than three orders of magnitude while preserving the thermodynamics of the systems. Coarse-grained simulations identify relevant structural states in the ensemble with comparable energetics to the all-atom systems. Furthermore, we show that a single coarse-grained potential can integrate all twelve proteins and can capture experimental structural features of mutated proteins. These results indicate that machine learning coarse-grained potentials could provide a feasible approach to simulate and understand protein dynamics.},

Statistical learning techniques and docking methods for predicting protein–protein interactions cannot quantitatively estimate binding free energies. Full atomistic molecular simulation methods do have this potential, but are completely unfeasible for large-scale applications in terms of computational cost required. Here we investigate whether applying coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations is a viable alternative for complexes of known structure.Results: We calculate the free energy barrier with respect to the bound state based on molecular dynamics simulations using both a full atomistic and a CG force field for the TCR–pMHC complex and the MP1–p14 scaffolding complex. We find that the free energy barriers from the CG simulations are of similar accuracy as those from the full atomistic ones, while achieving a speedup of \&gt;500-fold. We also observe that extensive sampling is extremely important to obtain accurate free energy barriers, which is only within reach for the CG models. Finally, we show that the CG model preserves biological relevance of the interactions: (i) we observe a strong correlation between evolutionary likelihood of mutations and the impact on the free energy barrier with respect to the bound state; and (ii) we confirm the dominant role of the interface core in these interactions. Therefore, our results suggest that CG molecular simulations can realistically be used for the accurate prediction of protein–protein interaction strength.Availability and implementation: The python analysis framework and data files are available for download at http://www.ibi.vu.nl/downloads/bioinformatics-2013-btt675.tgz.Contact: k.a.feenstra@vu.nlSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

To test this hypothesis, we developed a method within the Rosetta macromolecular modeling suite (flex ddG) that samples conformational diversity using “backrub” to generate an ensemble of models and then applies torsion minimization, side chain repacking, and averaging across this ensemble to estimate interface ΔΔG values. We tested our method on a curated benchmark set of 1240 mutants, and found the method outperformed existing methods that sampled conformational space to a lesser degree. We observed considerable improvements with flex ddG over existing methods on the subset of small side chain to large side chain mutations, as well as for multiple simultaneous non-alanine mutations, stabilizing mutations, and mutations in antibody–antigen interfaces. Finally, we applied a generalized additive model (GAM) approach to the Rosetta energy function; the resulting nonlinear reweighting model improved the agreement with experimentally determined interface ΔΔG values but also highlighted the necessity of future energy function improvements.},

Importantly, several clinical compounds act as molecular glue degraders that stabilize interactions between E3 ubiquitin ligases and target proteins, leading to their degradation. Molecular glues hold promise as a new generation of therapeutic agents, including those molecular glue degraders that can redirect the protein degradation machinery in a precise way. However, rational discovery of molecular glues is difficult in part due to the lack of understanding of the protein–protein interactions they stabilize. In this review, we summarize the structures of known molecular glue-induced ternary complexes and the interface properties. Detailed analysis shows different mechanisms of ternary structure formation. Additionally, we also review computational approaches for predicting protein–protein interfaces and highlight the promises and challenges. This information will ultimately help inform future approaches for rational molecular glue discovery., This review surveys molecular glue-induced ternary complexes in the PDB and provides an overview of computational methods that can be utilized to predict them.},

	abstract = {Predicting drug properties is key in drug discovery to enable de-risking of assets before expensive clinical trials, and to find highly active compounds faster. Interest from the Machine Learning community has led to the release of a variety of benchmark datasets and proposed methods. However, it remains unclear for practitioners which method or approach is most suitable, as different papers benchmark on different datasets and methods, leading to varying conclusions that are not easily compared. Our large-scale empirical study links together numerous earlier works on different datasets and methods; thus offering a comprehensive overview of the existing property classes, datasets, and their interactions with different methods. We emphasise the importance of uncertainty quantification and the time and therefore cost of applying these methods in the drug development decision-making cycle. We discover that the best method depends on the dataset, and that engineered features with classical ML methods often outperform deep learning. Specifically, QSAR datasets are typically best analysed with classical methods such as Gaussian Processes while ADMET datasets are sometimes better described by Trees or Deep Learning methods such as Graph Neural Networks or language models. Our work highlights that practitioners do not yet have a straightforward, black-box procedure to rely on, and sets the precedent for creating practitioner-relevant benchmarks. Deep learning approaches must be proven on these benchmarks to become the practical method of choice in drug property prediction.},

	abstract = {The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer. The code and models of Graphormer will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Microsoft/Graphormer.},

	abstract = {Advances in deep learning have greatly improved structure prediction of molecules. However, many macroscopic observations that are important for real-world applications are not functions of a single molecular structure, but rather determined from the equilibrium distribution of structures. Traditional methods for obtaining these distributions, such as molecular dynamics simulation, are computationally expensive and often intractable. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, called Distributional Graphormer (DiG), in an attempt to predict the equilibrium distribution of molecular systems. Inspired by the annealing process in thermodynamics, DiG employs deep neural networks to transform a simple distribution towards the equilibrium distribution, conditioned on a descriptor of a molecular system, such as a chemical graph or a protein sequence. This framework enables efficient generation of diverse conformations and provides estimations of state densities. We demonstrate the performance of DiG on several molecular tasks, including protein conformation sampling, ligand structure sampling, catalyst-adsorbate sampling, and property-guided structure generation. DiG presents a significant advancement in methodology for statistically understanding molecular systems, opening up new research opportunities in molecular science.},

We find that FEP performance is significantly better than that of other computational approaches examined here, in part due to its ability to account for protein structure relaxation resulting from the mutation of interfacial residues. Moreover, analysis of FEP trajectories offers physical insights not available from other methods. Notably, FEP calculations successfully predict the observed cooperative stabilization of binding by the Q498R N501Y double mutant present in the Omicron variant and offer a physical explanation for the underlying mechanism. Our results furthermore suggest a strategy as to how to effectively deploy FEP methods in the optimization of neutralizing antibodies.},

However, despite substantial efforts, no generally applicable computational method has been described. Here, we describe a systematic free energy perturbation (FEP) protocol and calculate the binding affinities between the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 and three broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of the VRC01 class. The protocol has been adapted from successful studies of small molecules to address the challenges associated with modeling protein–protein interactions. Specifically, we built homology models of the three antibody–gp120 complexes, extended the sampling times for large bulky residues, incorporated the modeling of glycans on the surface of gp120, and utilized continuum solvent-based loop prediction protocols to improve sampling. We present three experimental surface plasmon resonance data sets, in which antibody residues in the antibody/gp120 interface were systematically mutated to alanine. The RMS error in the large set (55 total cases) of FEP tests as compared to these experiments, 0.68 kcal/mol, is near experimental accuracy, and it compares favorably with the results obtained from a simpler, empirical methodology. The correlation coefficient for the combined data set including residues with glycan contacts, R2 = 0.49, should be sufficient to guide the choice of residues for antibody optimization projects, assuming that this level of accuracy can be realized in prospective prediction. More generally, these results are encouraging with regard to the possibility of using an FEP approach to calculate the magnitude of protein–protein binding affinities.,

Over the past decades, the synergy between steadily growing computational resources and unrelenting methodological developments has brought free-energy calculations into the arsenal of tools commonly utilized to tackle important questions that experiment alone has left unresolved. The continued emergence of new options to determine free energies has also bred confusion amid the community of users, who may find it difficult to choose the best-suited algorithm to address the problem at hand.

	abstract = {Several toxicities are clearly driven by free drug concentrations in plasma, such as toxicities related to on-target exaggerated pharmacology or off-target pharmacological activity associated with receptors, enzymes or ion channels. However, there are examples in which organ toxicities appear to correlate better with total drug concentrations in the target tissues, rather than with free drug concentrations in plasma. Here we present a case study in which a small molecule Met inhibitor, GEN-203, with significant liver and bone marrow toxicity in preclinical species was modified with the intention of increasing the safety margin. GEN-203 is a lipophilic weak base as demonstrated by its physicochemical and structural properties: high LogD (distribution coefficient) (4.3) and high measured pKa (7.45) due to the basic amine (N-ethyl-3-fluoro-4-aminopiperidine). The physicochemical properties of GEN-203 were hypothesized to drive the high distribution of this compound to tissues as evidenced by a moderately-high volume of distribution (Vd {\textgreater} 3 l/kg) in mouse and subsequent toxicities of the compound. Specifically, the basicity of GEN-203 was decreased through addition of a second fluorine in the 3-position of the aminopiperidine to yield GEN-890 (N-ethyl-3,3-difluoro-4-aminopiperidine), which decreased the volume of distribution of the compound in mouse (Vd = 1.0 l/kg), decreased its tissue drug concentrations and led to decreased toxicity in mice. This strategy suggests that when toxicity is driven by tissue drug concentrations, optimization of the physicochemical parameters that drive tissue distribution can result in decreased drug concentrations in tissues, resulting in lower toxicity and improved safety margins. -- Highlights: ► Lower pKa for a small molecule: reduced tissue drug levels and toxicity. ► New analysis tools to assess electrostatic effects and ionization are presented. ► Chemical and PK drivers of toxicity can be leveraged to improve safety.},

	abstract = {Permeation of many small molecules through lipid bilayers can be directly observed in molecular dynamics simulations on the nano- and microsecond timescale. While unbiased simulations provide an unobstructed view of the permeation process, their feasibility for computing permeability coefficients depends on various factors that differ for each permeant. The present work studies three small molecules for which unbiased simulations of permeation are feasible within less than a microsecond, one hydrophobic (oxygen), one hydrophilic (water), and one amphiphilic (ethanol). Permeabilities are computed using two approaches: counting methods and a maximum-likelihood estimation for the inhomogeneous solubility diffusion (ISD) model. Counting methods yield nearly model-free estimates of the permeability for all three permeants. While the ISD-based approach is reasonable for oxygen, it lacks precision for water due to insufficient sampling and results in misleading estimates for ethanol due to invalid model assumptions. It is also demonstrated that simulations using a Langevin thermostat with collision frequencies of 1/ps and 5/ps yield oxygen permeabilities and diffusion constants that are lower than those using Nosé–Hoover by statistically significant margins. In contrast, permeabilities from trajectories generated with Nosé–Hoover and the microcanonical ensemble do not show statistically significant differences. As molecular simulations become more affordable and accurate, calculation of permeability for an expanding range of molecules will be feasible using unbiased simulations. The present work summarizes theoretical underpinnings, identifies pitfalls, and develops best practices for such simulations.},

In this paper, we first propose to universally represent a 3D molecule as a geometric graph of sets, in contrast to conventional single-level representations. Upon the proposed unified representation, we then propose a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both sparse block-level and dense atom-level interactions. To be specific, GET consists of a bilevel attention module, a feed-forward module and a layer normalization module, where, notably, each module is E(3) equivariant to meet the symmetry of 3D world. Extensive experiments on the prediction of protein-protein affinity, ligand binding affinity, and ligand efficacy prediction verify the effectiveness of our proposed method against existing methods, and reveal its potential to learn transferable knowledge across different domains and different tasks.},

	abstract = {For an effective drug, strong binding to the target protein is a prerequisite but it is not enough. To produce a particular functional response, drugs need to either block the proteins’ functions or modulate their activities by changing the conformational equilibrium. The binding free energy of a compound to its target is routinely calculated but the time scales for the protein conformational changes are prohibitively long to be efficiently modeled via physics-based simulations. Thermodynamic principles suggest that binding free energies of the ligands with different receptor conformations may infer their efficacy. However, this hypothesis has not been thoroughly validated. We present an actionable protocol and a comprehensive study to show that binding thermodynamics provides a strong predictor for the efficacy of a ligand. We apply the absolute-binding free energy perturbation (ABFEP) method to ligands bound to active and inactive states of eight G protein–coupled receptors and a nuclear receptor, then compare the resulting binding free energies. We find that carefully designed restraints are often necessary to efficiently model the corresponding conformational ensembles for each state.

	abstract = {We introduce a rare-event sampling scheme, named Markovian Weighted Ensemble Milestoning (M-WEM), which inlays a weighted ensemble framework within a Markovian milestoning theory to efficiently calculate thermodynamic and kinetic properties of long-time-scale biomolecular processes from short atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. M-WEM is tested on the Müller–Brown potential model, the conformational switching in alanine dipeptide, and the millisecond time-scale protein–ligand unbinding in a trypsin–benzamidine complex. Not only can M-WEM predict the kinetics of these processes with quantitative accuracy but it also allows for a scheme to reconstruct a multidimensional free-energy landscape along additional degrees of freedom, which are not part of the milestoning progress coordinate. For the ligand–receptor system, the experimental residence time, association and dissociation kinetics, and binding free energy could be reproduced using M-WEM within a simulation time of a few hundreds of nanoseconds, which is a fraction of the computational cost of other currently available methods, and close to 4 orders of magnitude less than the experimental residence time. Due to the high accuracy and low computational cost, the M-WEM approach can find potential applications in kinetics and free-energy-based computational drug design.},

	abstract = {Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) expansion and persistence vary widely among patients and predict both efficacy and toxicity. However, the mechanisms underlying clinical outcomes and patient variability are poorly defined. In this study, we developed a mathematical description of T cell responses wherein transitions among memory, effector and exhausted T cell states are coordinately regulated by tumor antigen engagement. The model is trained using clinical data from CAR-T products in different hematological malignancies and identifies cell-intrinsic differences in the turnover rate of memory cells and cytotoxic potency of effectors as the primary determinants of clinical response. Using a machine learning workflow, we demonstrate that product-intrinsic differences can accurately predict patient outcomes based on pre-infusion transcriptomes, and additional pharmacological variance arises from cellular interactions with patient tumors. We found that transcriptional signatures outperform T cell immunophenotyping as predictive of clinical response for two CD19-targeted CAR-T products in three indications, enabling a new phase of predictive CAR-T product development.},

	abstract = {We describe novel humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed for therapeutic use on the basis of their physicochemical properties and cellular cytotoxicity. A distinct correlation between apparent dissociation constants (Kd) and apoptotic activity for eight murine anti-CD20 mAbs (OUBM1–OUBM8) and previously-developed murine anti-CD20 mAbs enabled us to categorize anti-CD20 mAbs into two groups. Group A mAbs had lower Kd values and did not induce definite apoptosis, while Group B mAbs had greater Kd values and did induce definite apoptosis. A murine version mAb of rituximab, 2B8, belongs to Group B. An epitope analysis showed that the epitope of two murine mAbs, OUBM3 and OUBM6, differed from that of 2B8 or 2F2 (ofatumumab). Two mAbs, OUBM3 from Group A and OUBM6 from Group B, were selected and humanized. As expected, the humanized OUBM3 with the lower Kd did not induce apoptosis, while the humanized OUBM6 (hOUBM6) with the greater Kd did. Both hOUBM3 and hOUBM6 induced highly-effective, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity against Burkitt’s and follicular lymphomas. Importantly, hOUBM6 exhibited cellular cytotoxicity against diffuse, large B cells that are less effectively depleted by rituximab and also exhibited effective cytotoxicity against tumor cells from human CD20(+) leukemia and lymphoma patients. These results suggest the potential impact of the further development of our anti-CD20 mAbs. Our study shows that the selection of mAbs based on their physicochemical parameters, followed by the biological activity assessment for the selected mAbs, is a rational and efficient approach for pharmaceutical mAb development.

	abstract = {In recent decades, antibodies have emerged as indispensable therapeutics for combating diseases, particularly viral infections. However, their development has been hindered by limited structural information and labor-intensive engineering processes. Fortunately, significant advancements in deep learning methods have facilitated the precise prediction of protein structure and function by leveraging co-evolution information from homologous proteins. Despite these advances, predicting the conformation of antibodies remains challenging due to their unique evolution and the high flexibility of their antigen-binding regions. Here, to address this challenge, we present the Bio-inspired Antibody Language Model (BALM). This model is trained on a vast dataset comprising 336 million 40\% non-redundant unlabeled antibody sequences, capturing both unique and conserved properties specific to antibodies. Notably, BALM showcases exceptional performance across four antigen-binding prediction tasks. Moreover, we introduce BALMFold, an end-to-end method derived from BALM, capable of swiftly predicting full atomic antibody structures from individual sequences. Remarkably, BALMFold outperforms those well-established methods like AlphaFold2, IgFold, ESMFold, and OmegaFold in the antibody benchmark, demonstrating significant potential to advance innovative engineering and streamline therapeutic antibody development by reducing the need for unnecessary trials.},

Such applications include identifying disease-associated screenable phenotypes, understanding disease mechanisms and predicting a drug’s activity, toxicity or mechanism of action. Several of these applications have been recently validated and have moved into production mode within academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Some of these have yielded disappointing results in practice but are now of renewed interest due to improved machine-learning strategies that better leverage image-based information.

Conditions to generate the main cell types (enterocyte, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and M cells) are well established, but signals to induce the spectrum of hormone-producing enteroendocrine cells (EECs) have remained elusive. Here, we induce Lgr5+ stem cell quiescence in vitro by blocking epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in organoids and show that their quiescent state is readily reverted. Quiescent Lgr5+ stem cells acquire a distinct molecular signature biased toward EEC differentiation. Indeed, combined inhibition of Wnt, Notch, and MAPK pathways efﬁciently generates a diversity of EEC hormone-expressing subtypes in vitro. Our observations uncouple Wnt-dependent stem cell maintenance from EGF-dependent proliferation and provide an approach for the study of the elusive EECs in a deﬁned environment.},

In this work, we study masked image modeling (MIM) and indicate the advantages and challenges of using a semantically meaningful visual tokenizer. We present a self-supervised framework iBOT that can perform masked prediction with an online tokenizer. Specifically, we perform self-distillation on masked patch tokens and take the teacher network as the online tokenizer, along with self-distillation on the class token to acquire visual semantics. The online tokenizer is jointly learnable with the MIM objective and dispenses with a multi-stage training pipeline where the tokenizer needs to be pre-trained beforehand. We show the prominence of iBOT by achieving an 82.3\% linear probing accuracy and an 87.8\% fine-tuning accuracy evaluated on ImageNet-1K. Beyond the state-of-the-art image classification results, we underline emerging local semantic patterns, which helps the models to obtain strong robustness against common corruptions and achieve leading results on dense downstream tasks, eg., object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.},

This work shows that existing pretraining methods, especially self-supervised methods, can produce such features if trained on enough curated data from diverse sources. We revisit existing approaches and combine different techniques to scale our pretraining in terms of data and model size. Most of the technical contributions aim at accelerating and stabilizing the training at scale. In terms of data, we propose an automatic pipeline to build a dedicated, diverse, and curated image dataset instead of uncurated data, as typically done in the self-supervised literature.

In particular, we emphasize the important contributions of long-term cell models, emerging uses for short-term cell models and future potential for ‘alpha cultures’ that are mere hours or days from the cancer patient. Collecting research-grade cancer dependency data with each of these model formats could pave the way to ensure that the Map increasingly reflects all tumors.

Although our method aligns the majority of cell lines with tumor samples of the same cancer type, it also reveals large differences in tumor similarity across cell lines. Using this approach, we identify several hundred cell lines from diverse lineages that present a more mesenchymal and undifferentiated transcriptional state and that exhibit distinct chemical and genetic dependencies.

Although cell lines are known to evolve in culture, the extent of the resultant genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity and its functional consequences remain understudied. Here we use genomic analyses of 106 human cell lines grown in two laboratories to show extensive clonal diversity. Further comprehensive genomic characterization of 27 strains of the common breast cancer cell line MCF7 uncovered rapid genetic diversification. Similar results were obtained with multiple strains of 13 additional cell lines. Notably, genetic changes were associated with differential activation of gene expression programs and marked differences in cell morphology and proliferation. Barcoding experiments showed that cell line evolution occurs as a result of positive clonal selection that is highly sensitive to culture conditions. Analyses of single-cell-derived clones demonstrated that continuous instability quickly translates into heterogeneity of the cell line. When the 27 MCF7 strains were tested against 321 anti-cancer compounds, we uncovered considerably different drug responses: at least 75\% of compounds that strongly inhibited some strains were completely inactive in others. This study documents the extent, origins and consequences of genetic variation within cell lines, and provides a framework for researchers to measure such variation in efforts to support maximally reproducible cancer research.},

Here, we aim to develop an in vitro functional assay of a patient’s living cancer cells that could complement these approaches. We present methods for developing cell cultures from tumor biopsies and identify the types of samples and culture conditions associated with higher efﬁciency of model establishment. Toward the application of patient-derived cell cultures for personalized care, we established an immunoﬂuorescence-based functional assay that quantiﬁes cancer cell responses to targeted therapy in mixed cell cultures. Assaying patient-derived lung cancer cultures with this method showed promise in modeling patient response for diagnostic use. This platform should allow for the development of co-clinical trial studies to prospectively test the value of drug proﬁling on tumor-biopsy-derived cultures to direct patient care.},

Crucial in this process is a first symmetry-breaking event, in which only a fraction of identical cells in a symmetrical sphere differentiate into Paneth cells, which generate the stem-cell niche and lead to asymmetric structures such as the crypts and villi. Here we combine single-cell quantitative genomic and imaging approaches to characterize the development of intestinal organoids from single cells. We show that their development follows a regeneration process that is driven by transient activation of the transcriptional regulator YAP1. Cell-to-cell variability in YAP1, emerging in symmetrical spheres, initiates Notch and DLL1 activation, and drives the symmetry-breaking event and formation of the first Paneth cell. Our findings reveal how single cells exposed to a uniform growth-promoting environment have the intrinsic ability to generate emergent, self-organized behaviour that results in the formation of complex multicellular asymmetric structures.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2206.07824},
	abstract = {A common theme in causal inference is learning causal relationships between observed variables, also known as causal discovery. This is usually a daunting task, given the large number of candidate causal graphs and the combinatorial nature of the search space. Perhaps for this reason, most research has so far focused on relatively small causal graphs, with up to hundreds of nodes. However, recent advances in fields like biology enable generating experimental data sets with thousands of interventions followed by rich profiling of thousands of variables, raising the opportunity and urgent need for large causal graph models. Here, we introduce the notion of factor directed acyclic graphs (f-DAGs) as a way to restrict the search space to non-linear low-rank causal interaction models. Combining this novel structural assumption with recent advances that bridge the gap between causal discovery and continuous optimization, we achieve causal discovery on thousands of variables. Additionally, as a model for the impact of statistical noise on this estimation procedure, we study a model of edge perturbations of the f-DAG skeleton based on random graphs and quantify the effect of such perturbations on the f-DAG rank. This theoretical analysis suggests that the set of candidate f-DAGs is much smaller than the whole DAG space and thus may be more suitable as a search space in the high-dimensional regime where the underlying skeleton is hard to assess. We propose Differentiable Causal Discovery of Factor Graphs (DCD-FG), a scalable implementation of -DAG constrained causal discovery for high-dimensional interventional data. DCD-FG uses a Gaussian non-linear low-rank structural equation model and shows significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods in both simulations as well as a recent large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing data set with hundreds of genetic interventions.},

	abstract = {Flow-based generative models have shown an excellent ability to explicitly learn the probability density function of data via a sequence of invertible transformations. Yet, learning attentions in generative ﬂows remains understudied, while it has made breakthroughs in other domains. To ﬁll the gap, this paper introduces two types of invertible attention mechanisms, i.e., map-based and transformer-based attentions, for both unconditional and conditional generative ﬂows. The key idea is to exploit a masked scheme of these two attentions to learn long-range data dependencies in the context of generative ﬂows. The masked scheme allows for invertible attention modules with tractable Jacobian determinants, enabling its seamless integration at any positions of the ﬂow-based models. The proposed attention mechanisms lead to more efﬁcient generative ﬂows, due to their capability of modeling the long-term data dependencies. Evaluation on multiple image synthesis tasks shows that the proposed attention ﬂows result in efﬁcient models and compare favorably against the state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional generative ﬂows.},

Aberrant PPIs have the potential to lead to disease, making PPIs promising targets for drug discovery. There are over 64,000 PPIs in the human interactome reference database; however, to date, very few PPI modulators have been approved for clinical use. Further development of PPI-specific therapeutics is highly dependent on the availability of structural data and the existence of reliable computational tools to explore the interface between two interacting proteins. The fragment molecular orbital (FMO) quantum mechanics method offers comprehensive and computationally inexpensive means of identifying the strength (in kcal/mol) and the chemical nature (electrostatic or hydrophobic) of the molecular interactions taking place at the protein–protein interface. We have integrated FMO and PPI exploration (FMO-PPI) to identify the residues that are critical for protein–protein binding (hotspots). To validate this approach, we have applied FMO-PPI to a dataset of protein–protein complexes representing several different protein subfamilies and obtained FMO-PPI results that are in agreement with published mutagenesis data. We observed that critical PPIs can be divided into three major categories: interactions between residues of two proteins (intermolecular), interactions between residues within the same protein (intramolecular), and interactions between residues of two proteins that are mediated by water molecules (water bridges). We extended our findings by demonstrating how this information obtained by FMO-PPI can be utilized to support the structure-based drug design of PPI modulators (SBDD-PPI).},

	abstract = {Aqueous solubility is a valuable yet challenging property to predict. Computing solubility using first-principles methods requires accounting for the competing effects of entropy and enthalpy, resulting in long computations for relatively poor accuracy. Data-driven approaches, such as deep learning, offer improved accuracy and computational efficiency but typically lack uncertainty quantification. Additionally, ease of use remains a concern for any computational technique, resulting in the sustained popularity of group-based contribution methods. In this work, we addressed these problems with a deep learning model with predictive uncertainty that runs on a static website (without a server). This approach moves computing needs onto the website visitor without requiring installation, removing the need to pay for and maintain servers. Our model achieves satisfactory results in solubility prediction. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to create molecular property prediction models that balance uncertainty and ease of use.

However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible.

In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20\% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.},

	abstract = {Solving the quantum many-body Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation is a fundamental and challenging problem in the fields of quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and material sciences. One of the common computational approaches to this problem is Quantum Variational Monte Carlo (QVMC), in which ground-state solutions are obtained by minimizing the energy of the system within a restricted family of parameterized wave functions. Deep learning methods partially address the limitations of traditional QVMC by representing a rich family of wave functions in terms of neural networks. However, the optimization objective in QVMC remains notoriously hard to minimize and requires second-order optimization methods such as natural gradient. In this paper, we first reformulate energy functional minimization in the space of Born distributions corresponding to particle-permutation (anti-)symmetric wave functions, rather than the space of wave functions. We then interpret QVMC as the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in this distributional space, followed by a projection step onto the variational manifold. This perspective provides us with a principled framework to derive new QMC algorithms, by endowing the distributional space with better metrics, and following the projected gradient flow induced by those metrics. More specifically, we propose "Wasserstein Quantum Monte Carlo" (WQMC), which uses the gradient flow induced by the Wasserstein metric, rather than Fisher-Rao metric, and corresponds to transporting the probability mass, rather than teleporting it. We demonstrate empirically that the dynamics of WQMC results in faster convergence to the ground state of molecular systems.},

To explain these methods and illustrate open methodological problems, we review some important principles of molecular physics and describe how they can be incorporated into ML structures.

The model captures Boltzmann statistics and also reproduces kinetics across a spectrum of timescales. We demonstrate how training the long short-term memory network is equivalent to learning a path entropy, and that its embedding layer, instead of representing contextual meaning of characters, here exhibits a nontrivial connectivity between different metastable states in the underlying physical system. We demonstrate our model’s reliability through different benchmark systems and a force spectroscopy trajectory for multi-state riboswitch.

	abstract = {The ever-increasing volumes of scientific data combined with sophisticated techniques for extracting information from them have led to the increasing popularity of ensemble workflows which are a collection of runs of individual workflows. A traditional approach followed by scientists to run ensembles is to rely on simple scripts to execute different runs and manage resources. This approach is not scalable and is error-prone, thereby motivating the development of workflow management systems that specialize in executing ensembles on HPC clusters. However, when the size of both the ensemble and the target system reach extreme scales, existing workflow management systems face new challenges that hamper their efficient execution. In this paper, we describe our experience scaling an ensemble workflow from the computational biology domain from the early design stages to the execution at extreme scale on Summit, a leadership class supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We discuss challenges that arise when scaling ensembles to several million runs on thousands of HPC nodes. We identify challenges with composition of the ensemble itself, its execution at large scale, post-processing of the generated data, and scalability of the file system. Based on the experience acquired, we develop a generic vision of the capabilities and abstractions to add to existing workflow management systems to enable the execution of ensemble workflows at extreme scales. We believe that the understanding of these fundamental challenges will help application teams along with workflow system developers with designing the next generation of infrastructure for composing and executing extreme-scale ensemble workflows.},

It is critical to understand the strengths and weaknesses of docking algorithms to increase the success rate in practical applications. Here, we systematically investigated the docking successes and failures of two representative docking programs: UCSF DOCK 3.7 and AutoDock Vina. DOCK 3.7 performed better in early enrichment on the Directory of Useful Decoys: Enhanced (DUD-E) data set, although both docking methods were roughly comparable in overall enrichment performance. DOCK 3.7 also showed superior computational efficiency. Intriguingly, the Vina scoring function showed a bias toward compounds with higher molecular weights. Both the tested docking approaches yielded incorrectly predicted ligand binding poses caused by the limitations of torsion sampling. Based on a careful analysis of docking results from six representative cases, we propose the reasons underlying docking failures; furthermore, we provide a few solutions, representing practical guidance for large-scale virtual screening campaigns and future docking algorithm development.},

Recently developed machine learning methods such as AlphaFold 2 (AF2) have dramatically improved protein structure prediction, with reported accuracy approaching that of experimentally determined structures. To what extent do these advances translate to an ability to predict more accurately how drugs and drug candidates bind to their target proteins? Here we carefully examine the utility of AF2 protein structure models for predicting binding poses of drug-like molecules at the largest class of drug targets, the G protein–coupled receptors. We find that AF2 models capture binding pocket structures much more accurately than traditional homology models, with errors nearly as small as differences between structures of the same protein determined experimentally with different ligands bound. Strikingly, however, the accuracy of ligand binding poses predicted by computational docking to AF2 models is not significantly higher than when docking to traditional homology models and is much lower than when docking to structures determined experimentally without these ligands bound. These results have important implications for all those who might use predicted protein structures for drug discovery.},

We used total variation similarity as our metric to assess the agreement between free energy surfaces of force fields and the mapped atomistic simulations. Additionally, force matching error was found to only be weakly correlated with a force field’s ability to reconstruct the correct free energy surface. These conclusions support the common hypothesis that constructing force fields on one region of the protein free energy surface can indeed extrapolate to unexplored regions.},

Using a subset of complexes with reliable experimental binding affinities and combining our contacts and contact-types-based model with recent observations on the role of the non-interacting surface in protein–protein interactions, we reach a high prediction accuracy for such a diverse dataset outperforming all other tested methods.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: The rapid drop in sequencing costs has produced many more (predicted) protein sequences than can feasibly be functionally annotated with wet-lab experiments. Thus, many computational methods have been developed for this purpose. Most of these methods employ homology-based inference, approximated via sequence alignments, to transfer functional annotations between proteins. The increase in the number of available sequences, however, has drastically increased the search space, thus significantly slowing down alignment methods.
RESULTS: Here we describe homology-derived functional similarity of proteins (HFSP), a novel computational method that uses results of a high-speed alignment algorithm, MMseqs2, to infer functional similarity of proteins on the basis of their alignment length and sequence identity. We show that our method is accurate (85\% precision) and fast (more than 40-fold speed increase over state-of-the-art). HFSP can help correct at least a 16\% error in legacy curations, even for a resource of as high quality as Swiss-Prot. These findings suggest HFSP as an ideal resource for large-scale functional annotation efforts.

The data provide molecular evidence that rather than being an isolated trait, MPB shares a substantial biological basis with numerous other human phenotypes and may deserve evaluation as an early prognostic marker, for example, for prostate cancer, sudden cardiac arrest and neurodegenerative disorders.},

To evaluate the model, we benchmark on the rotamer recovery task, the problem of predicting the conformation of a side chain from its context within a protein structure, which has been used to evaluate energy functions for protein design.

	abstract = {We introduce a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and a corresponding update rule. The new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the pattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new update rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This equivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models. These heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in higher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield network can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers improved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several hundreds of thousands of instances. On the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks, where deep learning methods typically struggle, Hopfield layers yielded a new state-of-the-art when compared to different machine learning methods. Finally, Hopfield layers achieved state-of-the-art on two drug design datasets. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers},

In this Perspective, we describe an emerging ‘differentiable biology’ in which phenomena ranging from the small and specific (for example, one experimental assay) to the broad and complex (for example, protein folding) can be modeled effectively and efficiently, often by exploiting knowledge about basic natural phenomena to overcome the limitations of sparse, incomplete and noisy data. By distilling differentiable biology into a small set of conceptual primitives and illustrative vignettes, we show how it can help to address long-standing challenges in integrating multimodal data from diverse experiments across biological scales. This promises to benefit fields as diverse as biophysics and functional genomics.},

            One of the critical issues in the philosophy of science is to understand scientific knowledge. This paper proposes a novel approach to the study of reflection on science, called “cognitive metascience”. In particular, it offers a new understanding of scientific knowledge as constituted by various kinds of scientific representations, framed as cognitive artifacts. It introduces a novel functional taxonomy of cognitive artifacts prevalent in scientific practice, covering a huge diversity of their formats, vehicles, and functions. As a consequence, toolboxes, conceptual frameworks, theories, models, and individual hypotheses can be understood as artifacts supporting our cognitive performance. It is also shown that by empirically studying how artifacts function, we may discover hitherto undiscussed virtues and vices of these scientific representations. This paper relies on the use of language technology to analyze scientific discourse empirically, which allows us to uncover the metascientific views of researchers. This, in turn, can become part of normative considerations concerning virtues and vices of cognitive artifacts.},

However, transformers for directed graphs are a surprisingly underexplored topic, despite their applicability to ubiquitous domains, including source code and logic circuits. In this work, we propose two direction- and structure-aware positional encodings for directed graphs: (1) the eigenvectors of the Magnetic Laplacian - a direction-aware generalization of the combinatorial Laplacian; (2) directional random walk encodings. Empirically, we show that the extra directionality information is useful in various downstream tasks, including correctness testing of sorting networks and source code understanding. Together with a data-flow-centric graph construction, our model outperforms the prior state of the art on the Open Graph Benchmark Code2 relatively by 14.7\%.},

Our approach (Webster) recovered pleiotropic functions for DNA damage proteins from genotoxic ﬁtness screens, untangled distinct signaling pathways upstream of shared effector proteins from cancer cell ﬁtness screens, and predicted the stoichiometry of an unknown protein complex subunit from ﬁtness data alone. Modeling compound sensitivity proﬁles in terms of genetic functions recovered compound mechanisms of action.

Because of the large chemical space spanned by drug-like molecules, classical force fields contain thousands of parameters describing atom-pair distance and torsional preferences; each parameter is typically optimized independently on simple representative molecules. Here, we describe a new approach in which small molecule force field parameters are jointly optimized guided by the rich source of information contained within thousands of available small molecule crystal structures. We optimize parameters by requiring that the experimentally determined molecular lattice arrangements have lower energy than all alternative lattice arrangements. Thousands of independent crystal lattice-prediction simulations were run on each of 1386 small molecule crystal structures, and energy function parameters of an implicit solvent energy model were optimized, so native crystal lattice arrangements had the lowest energy. The resulting energy model was implemented in Rosetta, together with a rapid genetic algorithm docking method employing grid-based scoring and receptor flexibility. The success rate of bound structure recapitulation in cross-docking on 1112 complexes was improved by more than 10\% over previously published methods, with solutions within {\textless}1 Å in over half of the cases. Our results demonstrate that small molecule crystal structures are a rich source of information for guiding molecular force field development, and the improved Rosetta energy function should increase accuracy in a wide range of small molecule structure prediction and design studies.},

Rather than using traditional atom typing, our approach is built on the SMIRKS-native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) parameter assignment formalism, which handles increases in the diversity and specificity of the force field definition without needlessly increasing the complexity of the specification. Parameters are optimized with the ForceBalance tool, based on reference quantum chemical data that include torsion potential energy profiles, optimized gas-phase structures, and vibrational frequencies. These quantum reference data are computed and are maintained with QCArchive, an open-source and freely available distributed computing and database software ecosystem. In this initial application of the method, we present essentially a full optimization of all valence parameters and report tests of the resulting force field against compounds and data types outside the training set. These tests show improvements in optimized geometries and conformational energetics and demonstrate that Parsley’s accuracy for liquid properties is similar to that of other general force fields, as is accuracy on binding free energies. We find that this initial Parsley force field affords accuracy similar to that of other general force fields when used to calculate relative binding free energies spanning 199 protein–ligand systems. Additionally, the resulting infrastructure allows us to rapidly optimize an entirely new force field with minimal human intervention.},

Using both theoretical analysis and multiscale simulations, we demonstrate that the anticorrelation between the premutation ΔG and the arising mutational effect (ΔΔG), purely biophysical in origin, is a necessary requirement for abundance-evolutionary rate covariation. Additionally, we predict and demonstrate in bacteria that the strength of abundance-evolutionary rate correlation depends on the divergence time separating reference genomes.

Proteins with more reproducible measurements tend to have a higher mRNAprotein correlation, suggesting that measurement reproducibility accounts for a substantial fraction of the unexplained variation between mRNA and protein abundances. The reproducibility of individual proteins is somewhat consistent across studies, and we exploit this to develop an aggregate reproducibility score that explains a substantial amount of the variation in mRNA-protein correlations across multiple studies. Finally, we show that pathways previously reported to have a higher-than-average mRNA-protein correlation may simply contain members that can be more reproducibly quantiﬁed.},

The pattern of postponement and compression across different birth cohorts explain why longevity records have been slow to increase in recent years: we find that cohorts born between around 1900 and 1950 are experiencing historically unprecedented mortality postponement, but are still too young to break longevity records. As these cohorts attain advanced ages in coming decades, longevity records may therefore increase significantly.

By applying finite mixture regression models, principal component analysis, and random-effects panel regression models, we find that (1) the negative correlation between the initial adulthood mortality rate and the rate of increase in mortality with age derived in the SM theory exists but is not constant; (2) within the SM framework, the implied age of expected zero vitality (expected maximum survival age) also is variable over time; (3) longevity trajectories are not homogeneous among the countries; (4) Central American and Southeast Asian countries have higher expected age of zero vitality than other countries in spite of relatively disadvantageous national ecological systems; (5) within the group of Central American and Southeast Asian countries, a more disadvantageous national ecological system is associated with a higher expected age of zero vitality; and (6) larger agricultural and food productivities, higher labor participation rates, higher percentages of population living in urban areas, and larger GDP per capita and GDP per unit of energy use are important beneficial national ecological system factors that can promote survival.

Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims instead to infer causally related (thus often statistically dependent) latent variables, together with the unknown graph encoding their causal relationships. We introduce an intermediate problem termed Causal Component Analysis (CauCA). CauCA can be viewed as a generalization of ICA, modelling the causal dependence among the latent components, and as a special case of CRL. In contrast to CRL, it presupposes knowledge of the causal graph, focusing solely on learning the unmixing function and the causal mechanisms. Any impossibility results regarding the recovery of the ground truth in CauCA also apply for CRL, while possibility results may serve as a stepping stone for extensions to CRL. We characterize CauCA identifiability from multiple datasets generated through different types of interventions on the latent causal variables. As a corollary, this interventional perspective also leads to new identifiability results for nonlinear ICA -- a special case of CauCA with an empty graph -- requiring strictly fewer datasets than previous results. We introduce a likelihood-based approach using normalizing flows to estimate both the unmixing function and the causal mechanisms, and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive synthetic experiments in the CauCA and ICA setting.},

	abstract = {We present an integrated approach to Probabilistic ICA for FMRI data that allows for nonsquare mixing in the presence of Gaussian noise. In order to avoid overﬁtting, we employ objective estimation of the amount of Gaussian noise through Bayesian analysis of the true dimensionality of the data, i.e. the number of activation and non-Gaussian noise sources. This enables us to carry out probabilistic modelling and achieves an asymptotically unique decomposition of the data. It reduces problems of interpretation, as each ﬁnal independent component is now much more likely to be due to only one physical or physiological process. We also describe other improvements to standard ICA, such as temporal pre-whitening and variance normalisation of timeseries, the latter being particularly useful in the context of dimensionality reduction when weak activation is present. We discuss the use of prior information about the spatiotemporal nature of the source processes, and an alternative-hypothesis testing approach for inference, using Gaussian mixture models. The performance of our approach is illustrated and evaluated on real and artiﬁcial FMRI data, and compared to the spatio-temporal accuracy of results obtained from classical ICA and GLM analyses.},

	abstract = {Valid causal inference in observational studies often requires controlling for confounders. However, in practice measurements of confounders may be noisy, and can lead to biased estimates of causal effects. We show that we can reduce the bias caused by measurement noise using a large number of noisy measurements of the underlying confounders. We propose the use of matrix factorization to infer the confounders from noisy covariates, a flexible and principled framework that adapts to missing values, accommodates a wide variety of data types, and can augment many causal inference methods. We bound the error for the induced average treatment effect estimator and show it is consistent in a linear regression setting, using Exponential Family Matrix Completion preprocessing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure in numerical experiments with both synthetic data and real clinical data.},

	abstract = {Matrix completion is the study of recovering an underlying matrix from a sparse subset of noisy observations. Traditionally, it is assumed that the entries of the matrix are “missing completely at random” (MCAR), i.e., each entry is revealed at random, independent of everything else, with uniform probability. This is likely unrealistic due to the presence of “latent confounders”, i.e., unobserved factors that determine both the entries of the underlying matrix and the missingness pattern in the observed matrix. For example, in the context of movie recommender systems—a canonical application for matrix completion—a user who vehemently dislikes horror films is unlikely to ever watch horror films. In general, these confounders yield “missing not at random” (MNAR) data, which can severely impact any inference procedure that does not correct for this bias. We develop a formal causal model for matrix completion through the language of potential outcomes, and provide novel identification arguments for a variety of causal estimands of interest. We design a procedure, which we call “synthetic nearest neighbors” (SNN), to estimate these causal estimands. We prove finite-sample consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator. Our analysis also leads to new theoretical results for the matrix completion literature. In particular, we establish entry-wise, i.e., max-norm, finite-sample consistency and asymptotic normality results for matrix completion with MNAR data. As a special case, this also provides entry-wise bounds for matrix completion with MCAR data. Across simulated and real data, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed estimator.},

	abstract = {Successful drug discovery is like finding oases of safety and efficacy in chemical and biological deserts. Screens in disease models, and other decision tools used in drug research and development (R\&D), point towards oases when they score therapeutic candidates in a way that correlates with clinical utility in humans. Otherwise, they probably lead in the wrong direction. This line of thought can be quantified by using decision theory, in which ‘predictive validity’ is the correlation coefficient between the output of a decision tool and clinical utility across therapeutic candidates. Analyses based on this approach reveal that the detectability of good candidates is extremely sensitive to predictive validity, because the deserts are big and oases small. Both history and decision theory suggest that predictive validity is under-managed in drug R\&D, not least because it is so hard to measure before projects succeed or fail later in the process. This article explains the influence of predictive validity on R\&D productivity and discusses methods to evaluate and improve it, with the aim of supporting the application of more effective decision tools and catalysing investment in their creation.},

Publication is largely done in the same manner today as it was fifty years ago. Many journals have adopted electronic formats, however, their orientation and style is little different from a printed document. The documents tend to be static and take little advantage of computational resources that might be available. Recent work, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003), suggests a methodology and basic infrastructure that can be used to publish documents in a substantially different way. Their approach is suitable for the publication of papers whose message relies on computation. Stated quite simply, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003) propose a paradigm where documents are mixtures of code and text. Such documents may be self-contained or they may be a component of a compendium which provides the infrastructure needed to provide access to data and supporting software. These documents, or compendiums, can be processed in a number of different ways. One transformation will be to replace the code with its output -- thereby providing the familiar, but limited, static document. In this paper we apply these concepts to a seminal paper in bioinformatics, namely The Molecular Classification of Cancer, Golub et al (1999). The authors of that paper have generously provided data and other information that have allowed us to largely reproduce their results. Rather than reproduce this paper exactly we demonstrate that such a reproduction is possible and instead concentrate on demonstrating the usefulness of the compendium concept itself.},

Here we explore the use of the recently developed deep learning method, AlphaFold, to predict structures of protein complexes from sequence. With a benchmark of 152 diverse heterodimeric protein complexes, multiple implementations and parameters of AlphaFold were tested for accuracy. Remarkably, many cases (43\%) had near-native models (medium or high critical assessment of predicted interactions accuracy) generated as top-ranked predictions by AlphaFold, greatly surpassing the performance of unbound protein–protein docking (9\% success rate for near-native top-ranked models), however AlphaFold modeling of antibody–antigen complexes within our set was unsuccessful. We identified sequence and structural features associated with lack of AlphaFold success, and we also investigated the impact of multiple sequence alignment input. Benchmarking of a multimer-optimized version of AlphaFold (AlphaFold-Multimer) with a set of recently released antibody–antigen structures confirmed a low rate of success for antibody–antigen complexes (11\% success), and we found that T cell receptor–antigen complexes are likewise not accurately modeled by that algorithm, showing that adaptive immune recognition poses a challenge for the current AlphaFold algorithm and model. Overall, our study demonstrates that end-to-end deep learning can accurately model many transient protein complexes, and highlights areas of improvement for future developments to reliably model any protein–protein interaction of interest.},

We developed a de novo design strategy for generating programmed membrane proteins (proMPs): single-pass α-helical TMDs that self-assemble through computationally defined and crystallographically validated interfaces. We used these proMPs to program specific oligomeric interactions into a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that we expressed in mouse primary T cells and found that both in vitro CAR T cell cytokine release and in vivo antitumor activity scaled linearly with the oligomeric state encoded by the receptor TMD, from monomers up to tetramers. All programmed CARs stimulated substantially lower T cell cytokine release relative to the commonly used CD28 TMD, which we show elevated cytokine release through lateral recruitment of the endogenous T cell costimulatory receptor CD28. Precise design using orthogonal and modular TMDs thus provides a new way to program receptor structure and predictably tune activity for basic or applied synthetic biology.},

M proteins generally exist as dimers. In virus assembly, they are the main driving force for envelope formation through lateral interactions and interactions with other viral structural proteins that play a central role. We built 100 candidate models and finally analyzed the six most convincing structural features of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein dimer based on long-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, multiple free energy analyses (potential mean force (PMF) and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA)) and principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain the most reasonable structure. The dimer stability was found to depend on the Leu-Ile zipper motif and aromatic amino acids in the transmembrane domain (TMD). Furthermore, the C-terminal domain (CTD) effects were relatively small. These results highlight a model in which there is sufficient binding affinity between the TMDs of M proteins to form dimers through the residues at the interface of the three transmembrane helices (TMHs).

Here, we evaluate the use of AlphaFold2 (AF2) predictions in the study of characteristic structural elements; the impact of missense variants; function and ligand binding site predictions; modeling of interactions; and modeling of experimental structural data. For 11 proteomes, an average of 25\% additional residues can be confidently modeled when compared with homology modeling, identifying structural features rarely seen in the Protein Data Bank. AF2-based predictions of protein disorder and complexes surpass dedicated tools, and AF2 models can be used across diverse applications equally well compared with experimentally determined structures, when the confidence metrics are critically considered.

Although many studies have been performed on isolated soluble extra- and intracellular receptor domains in aqueous solutions, limited knowledge exists on the lipid embedded TM domain. In this study, we examine the assembly of configurations of receptor TM region dimers using the Martini 3 force field for coarse-grain (CG) molecular dynamics simulations. This recently published version of Martini has new bead types and sizes, which allows more accurate predictions of molecular interactions compared to the previous versions. At first glance our results with Martini 3 simulations show only a reasonable agreement with ab initio predictions using PREDDIMER (for TM domains only), AlphaFold2 Multimer and with available NMR derived structures for TM helix dimers. Specifically, 6 of 11 CG TM structures are similar to the NMR structures (within {\textless} 3.5 Å mainchain RMSD) compared to 10 of 11 and 9 of 11 using PREDDIMER and Alphafold, respectively (7 structures of the latter are within 1.5 Å) Surprisingly, AlphaFold2 predictions are more comparable with NMR structures when the database of 2001 (mainly composed of soluble proteins) instead of 2020 PDB structures are used. While there are some differences in the conditions used, the CG simulations primarily reveal that alternate configurations of the TM dimers that are sampled, which readily interconvert with a predominant population. The implications of these findings for our understanding of the signalling mechanism of TM receptors are discussed, including opportunities for the development of new pharmaceuticals, some of which are peptide based.},

Despite overwhelming scientific, clinical, and public interest in this rapidly expanding field, fundamental inquiries into CAR T cell mechanistic functioning are still in their infancy. Because CAR T cells are manufactured from donor T lymphocytes, and because CARs incorporate well-characterized T cell signaling components, it has largely been assumed that CARs signal analogously to canonical T cell receptors (TCRs). However, recent studies demonstrate that many aspects of CAR signaling are unique, distinct from endogenous TCR signaling, and potentially even distinct among various CAR constructs. Thus, rigorous and comprehensive proteomic investigations are required for rational engineering of improved CARs.

	abstract = {The molecular events that permit the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to bind and enter cells are important to understand for both fundamental and therapeutic reasons. Spike proteins consist of S1 and S2 domains, which recognize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and contain the viral fusion machinery, respectively. Ostensibly, the binding of spike trimers to ACE2 receptors promotes dissociation of the S1 domains and exposure of the fusion machinery, although the molecular details of this process have yet to be observed. We report the development of bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) models consistent with cryo-electron tomography data, and the use of CG molecular dynamics simulations to investigate viral binding and S2 core exposure. We show that spike trimers cooperatively bind to multiple ACE2 dimers at virion-cell interfaces in a manner distinct from binding between soluble proteins, which processively induces S1 dissociation. We also simulate possible variant behavior using perturbed CG models, and find that ACE2-induced S1 dissociation is primarily sensitive to conformational state populations and the extent of S1/S2 cleavage, rather than ACE2 binding affinity. These simulations reveal an important concerted interaction between spike trimers and ACE2 dimers that primes the virus for membrane fusion and entry.},

	abstract = {Cancer biology involves complex, dynamic interactions between cancer cells and their tissue microenvironments. Single-cell effects are critical drivers of clinical progression. Chemical and mechanical communication between tumor and stromal cells can co-opt normal physiologic processes to promote growth and invasion. Cancer cell heterogeneity increases cancer’s ability to test strategies to adapt to microenvironmental stresses. Hypoxia and treatment can select for cancer stem cells and drive invasion and resistance. Cell-based computational models (also known as discrete models, agent-based models, or individual-based models) simulate individual cells as they interact in virtual tissues, which allows us to explore how single-cell behaviors lead to the dynamics we observe and work to control in cancer systems. In this review, we introduce the broad range of techniques available for cell-based computational modeling. The approaches can range from highly detailed models of just a few cells and their morphologies to millions of simpler cells in three-dimensional tissues. Modeling individual cells allows us to directly translate biologic observations into simulation rules. In many cases, individual cell agents include molecular-scale models. Most models also simulate the transport of oxygen, drugs, and growth factors, which allow us to link cancer development to microenvironmental conditions. We illustrate these methods with examples drawn from cancer hypoxia, angiogenesis, invasion, stem cells, and immunosurveillance. An ecosystem of interoperable cell-based simulation tools is emerging at a time when cloud computing resources make software easier to access and supercomputing resources make large-scale simulation studies possible. As the field develops, we anticipate that high-throughput simulation studies will allow us to rapidly explore the space of biologic possibilities, prescreen new therapeutic strategies, and even re-engineer tumor and stromal cells to bring cancer systems under control.},

Our methodology involves simulating proteins with molecular dynamics and utilizing the resulting trajectories to train a neural network potential through differentiable trajectory reweighting. Remarkably, this method requires only the native conformation of proteins, eliminating the need for labeled data derived from extensive simulations or memory-intensive end-to-end differentiable simulations. Once trained, the model can be employed to run parallel molecular dynamics simulations and sample folding events for proteins both within and beyond the training distribution, showcasing its extrapolation capabilities. By applying Markov State Models, native-like conformations of the simulated proteins can be predicted from the coarse-grained simulations. Owing to its theoretical transferability and ability to use solely experimental static structures as training data, we anticipate that this approach will prove advantageous for developing new protein force fields and further advancing the study of protein dynamics, folding, and interactions.},

Second, an enhanced search method is used to efficiently sample a broad range of protein conformations. Third, multiple conformations are identified and clustered from simulation data and further projected on a three-dimensional globe specifying protein orientations and interacting energies. Results from several complexes indicate that the crystal-like conformation is favorable on the energy landscape even if the landscape is relatively rugged with metastable conformations. A closer examination on molecular forces shows that the formation of associated protein complexes can be primarily electrostatics-driven, hydrophobics-driven, or a combination of both in stabilizing specific binding interfaces. Taken together, these results suggest that the coarse-grained simulations and analyses provide an alternative toolset to study protein-protein association occurring in functional biomolecular complexes.},

The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex vivo drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used MOFA to analyse single-cell multi-omics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, several broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that confer protection against diverse influenza strains have been isolated. Structural and biochemical characterization of these bnAbs has provided molecular insight into how they bind distinct antigens. However, our understanding of the evolutionary pathways leading to bnAbs, and thus how best to elicit them, remains limited. Here, we measure equilibrium dissociation constants of combinatorially complete mutational libraries for two naturally isolated influenza bnAbs (CR9114, 16 heavy-chain mutations; CR6261, 11 heavy-chain mutations), reconstructing all possible evolutionary intermediates back to the unmutated germline sequences. We find that these two libraries exhibit strikingly different patterns of breadth: while many variants of CR6261 display moderate affinity to diverse antigens, those of CR9114 display appreciable affinity only in specific, nested combinations. By examining the extensive pairwise and higher order epistasis between mutations, we find key sites with strong synergistic interactions that are highly similar across antigens for CR6261 and different for CR9114. Together, these features of the binding affinity landscapes strongly favor sequential acquisition of affinity to diverse antigens for CR9114, while the acquisition of breadth to more similar antigens for CR6261 is less constrained. These results, if generalizable to other bnAbs, may explain the molecular basis for the widespread observation that sequential exposure favors greater breadth, and such mechanistic insight will be essential for predicting and eliciting broadly protective immune responses.},

Thus, structure-based (Go̅) models have, aided by coarse-graining techniques, shown great success in capturing the mechanisms of protein folding and conformational changes. In certain cases, however, non-native interactions and atomic details are also essential to describe the protein dynamics, prompting the development of a variety of structure-based models that include non-native interactions, and differentiate between different types of attractive potentials. Here, we describe an all-protein-atom hybrid model, termed ProfasiGo, that integrates an implicit solvent all-atom physics-based model (called Profasi) and a structure-based Go̅ potential and its implementation in two software packages (PHAISTOS and ProFASi) that are developed for Monte Carlo sampling of protein molecules. We apply the ProfasiGo model to study the folding free energy landscapes of four topologically similar proteins, one of which can be folded by the simplified potential Profasi and two that have been folded by explicit solvent, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with the CHARMM22* force field. Our results reveal that the hybrid ProfasiGo model is able to capture many of the details present in the physics-based potentials while retaining the advantages of Go̅ models for sampling and guiding to the native state. We expect that the model will be widely applicable to the study of the folding of more complex proteins or to the study of conformational dynamics and integration with experimental data.},

Our analyses reveal a common network of genes under convergent evolution, encompassing established aging regulators such as insulin signaling, yet also identify flavonoid (aryl-hydrocarbon) metabolism as a pathway modulating longevity. The selective pressures on these pathways indicate the ancestral state of rockfishes was long lived and that the changes in short-lived lineages are adaptive. These pathways were also used to explore genome-wide association studies of human longevity, identifying the aryl-hydrocarbon metabolism pathway to be significantly associated with human survival to the 99th percentile.

Part of this resistance to cancer has been attributed to the fact that NMRs produce a modified form of hyaluronan—a key constituent of the extracellular matrix—that is thought to confer increased elasticity of the skin as an adaptation for living in narrow tunnels. This so-called high molecular mass hyaluronan (HMM-HA) stems from two apparently unique substitutions in the hyaluronan synthase 2 enzyme (HAS2). To test whether other subterranean mammals with similar selection pressures also show molecular adaptation in their HAS2 gene, we sequenced the HAS2 gene for 11 subterranean mammals and closely related species, and combined these with data from 57 other mammals. Comparative screening revealed that one of the two putatively important HAS2 substitutions in the NMR predicted to have a significant effect on hyaluronan synthase function was uniquely shared by all African mole-rats. Interestingly, we also identified multiple other amino acid substitutions in key domains of the HAS2 molecule, although the biological consequences of these for hyaluronan synthesis remain to be determined. Despite these results, we found evidence of strong purifying selection acting on the HAS2 gene across all mammals, and the NMR remains unique in its particular HAS2 sequence. Our results indicate that more work is needed to determine whether the apparent cancer resistance seen in NMR is shared by other members of the African mole-rat clade.},

Thus far, however, there is limited data available on side effects or efficacy associated with use of rapamycin in this context. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, we collected data from 333 adults with a history of off-label use of rapamycin by survey. Similar data were also collected from 172 adults who had never used rapamycin.

	abstract = {A fundamental question in biology is how a limited number of genes combinatorially govern cellular responses to environmental changes. While the prevailing hypothesis is that relationships between genes, processes, and ontologies could be plastic to achieve this adaptability, quantitatively comparing human gene functional connections between specific environmental conditions at scale is very challenging. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how human genetic interaction networks are rewired in response to changing environmental conditions. Here, we developed a framework for mapping context-specific genetic interactions, enabling us to measure the plasticity of human genetic architecture upon environmental challenge for ∼250,000 interactions, using cell cycle interruption, genotoxic perturbation, and nutrient deprivation as archetypes. We discover large-scale rewiring of human gene relationships across conditions, highlighted by dramatic shifts in the functional connections of epigenetic regulators (TIP60), cell cycle regulators (PP2A), and glycolysis metabolism. Our study demonstrates that upon environmental perturbation, intra-complex genetic rewiring is rare while inter-complex rewiring is common, suggesting a modular and flexible evolutionary genetic strategy that allows a limited number of human genes to enable adaptation to a large number of environmental conditions.

	abstract = {This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.},

We present Dodrio, an open-source interactive visualization tool to help NLP researchers and practitioners analyze attention mechanisms in transformer-based models with linguistic knowledge. Dodrio tightly integrates an overview that summarizes the roles of different attention heads, and detailed views that help users compare attention weights with the syntactic structure and semantic information in the input text. To facilitate the visual comparison of attention weights and linguistic knowledge, Dodrio applies different graph visualization techniques to represent attention weights scalable to longer input text.

Yet, state-of-the-art methods build upon simple long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, thus rendering inferences for complex, long-range dependencies challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel Causal Transformer for estimating counterfactual outcomes over time. Our model is specifically designed to capture complex, long-range dependencies among time-varying confounders. For this, we combine three transformer subnetworks with separate inputs for time-varying covariates, previous treatments, and previous outcomes into a joint network with in-between cross-attentions. We further develop a custom, end-to-end training procedure for our Causal Transformer. Specifically, we propose a novel counterfactual domain confusion loss to address confounding bias: it aims to learn adversarial balanced representations, so that they are predictive of the next outcome but non-predictive of the current treatment assignment. We evaluate our Causal Transformer based on synthetic and real-world datasets, where it achieves superior performance over current baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposing transformer-based architecture for estimating counterfactual outcomes from longitudinal data.},

In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different strategy: We formulate the structure learning problem as a purely {\textbackslash}emph\{continuous\} optimization problem over real matrices that avoids this combinatorial constraint entirely. This is achieved by a novel characterization of acyclicity that is not only smooth but also exact. The resulting problem can be efficiently solved by standard numerical algorithms, which also makes implementation effortless. The proposed method outperforms existing ones, without imposing any structural assumptions on the graph such as bounded treewidth or in-degree.

Senescence induction is a complex process not well defined yet and is characterized by a series of molecular changes acquired after an initial growth arrest. We found that fatty acid synthase (FASN) levels increase during the induction of senescence in mouse hepatic stellate cells and human primary fibroblasts. Importantly, we also observed a significant increase in FASN levels during ageing in mouse liver tissues. To probe the central role of FASN in senescence induction, we used a small-molecule inhibitor of FASN activity, C75. We found that C75 treatment prevented the induction of senescence in mouse and human senescent cells. Importantly, C75 also reduced the expression of the signature SASP factors interleukin 1α (IL-1α), IL-1β and IL-6, and suppressed the secretion of small extracellular vesicles. These findings were confirmed using a shRNA targeting FASN. In addition, we find that FASN inhibition induces metabolic changes in senescent cells.

Carcinoma cells harboring BRAFV600E remain resistant towards alterations of glucose supply or application of signaling or metabolic inhibitors.

Here, we report a role for MEK-driven lactate production in mTORC1 activation in KRAS-activated cells. KRAS/MEK-induced upregulation of the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcriptional factor II (COUP-TFII) increases the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), resulting in lactate production and mTORC1 activation. Further, lactate inhibits the interaction of TSC2 and Rheb, leading to the cellular activation of mTORC1 irrespective of growth factor stimulation.

	abstract = {Modeling mechanisms is central to the biological sciences – for purposes of explanation, prediction, extrapolation, and manipulation. A closer look at the philosophical literature reveals that mechanisms are predominantly modeled in a purely qualitative way. That is, mechanistic models are conceived of as representing how certain entities and activities are spatially and temporally organized so that they bring about the behavior of the mechanism in question. Although this adequately characterizes how mechanisms are represented in biology textbooks, contemporary biological research practice shows the need for quantitative, probabilistic models of mechanisms, too. In this paper we argue that the formal framework of causal graph theory is well-suited to provide us with models of biological mechanisms that incorporate quantitative and probabilistic information. On the basis of an example from contemporary biological practice, namely feedback regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis in Brassica napus, we show that causal graph theoretical models can account for feedback as well as for the multi-level character of mechanisms. However, we do not claim that causal graph theoretical representations of mechanisms are advantageous in all respects and should replace common qualitative models. Rather, we endorse the more balanced view that causal graph theoretical models of mechanisms are useful for some purposes, while being insufficient for others.},

At present, senescent cells are identified by the combined presence of multiple traits, such as senescence-associated protein expression and secretion, DNA damage and β-galactosidase activity; unfortunately, these traits are neither exclusively nor universally present in senescent cells. To identify robust shared markers of senescence, we have performed RNA-sequencing analysis across eight diverse models of senescence triggered in human diploid fibroblasts (WI-38, IMR-90) and endothelial cells (HUVEC, HAEC) by replicative exhaustion, exposure to ionizing radiation or doxorubicin, and expression of the oncogene HRASG12V. The intersection of the altered transcriptomes revealed 50 RNAs consistently elevated and 18 RNAs consistently reduced across all senescence models, including many protein-coding mRNAs and some non-coding RNAs.

Here, we evaluate the relative strength of three high-throughput data sources—chemical structures, imaging (Cell Painting), and gene-expression profiles (L1000)—to predict compound bioactivity using a historical collection of 16,170 compounds tested in 270 assays for a total of 585,439 readouts. All three data modalities can predict compound activity for 6–10\% of assays, and in combination they predict 21\% of assays with high accuracy, which is a 2 to 3 times higher success rate than using a single modality alone. In practice, the accuracy of predictors could be lower and still be useful, increasing the assays that can be predicted from 37\% with chemical structures alone up to 64\% when combined with phenotypic data. Our study shows that unbiased phenotypic profiling can be leveraged to enhance compound bioactivity prediction to accelerate the early stages of the drug-discovery process.},

While these components lead to effective accuracies and attractive FLOP counts, the added complexity actually makes these transformers slower than their vanilla ViT counterparts.

By pretraining with a strong visual pretext task (MAE), we can strip out all the bells-and-whistles from a state-of-the-art multi-stage vision transformer without losing accuracy. In the process, we create Hiera, an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training.

	abstract = {This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75\%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8\%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pre-training and shows promising scaling behavior.},

This technology is being used in the cancer field to predict the response of a patient-derived tumor to a certain drug or treatment serving as patient stratification and drug-guidance approaches. Modeling aging with patient-derived organoids has a tremendous potential as a preclinical model tool to discover new biomarkers of aging, to predict adverse outcomes during aging, and to design personalized approaches for the prevention and treatment of aging-related diseases and geriatric syndromes.

Reconstructing appendage-bearing skin in cultures and in bioengineered grafts is a biomedical challenge that has yet to be met3–9. Here we report an organoid culture system that generates complex skin from human pluripotent stem cells. We use stepwise modulation of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling pathways to co-induce cranial epithelial cells and neural crest cells within a spherical cell aggregate. During an incubation period of 4–5 months, we observe the emergence of a cyst-like skin organoid composed of stratified epidermis, fat-rich dermis and pigmented hair follicles that are equipped with sebaceous glands. A network of sensory neurons and Schwann cells form nerve-like bundles that target Merkel cells in organoid hair follicles, mimicking the neural circuitry associated with human touch. Single-cell RNA sequencing and direct comparison to fetal specimens suggest that the skin organoids are equivalent to the facial skin of human fetuses in the second trimester of development. Moreover, we show that skin organoids form planar hair-bearing skin when grafted onto nude mice. Together, our results demonstrate that nearly complete skin can self-assemble in vitro and be used to reconstitute skin in vivo. We anticipate that our skin organoids will provide a foundation for future studies of human skin development, disease modelling and reconstructive surgery.},

Here we introduce Smart-seq3, which combines full-length transcriptome coverage with a 5′ unique molecular identifier RNA counting strategy that enables in silico reconstruction of thousands of RNA molecules per cell. Of the counted and reconstructed molecules, 60\% could be directly assigned to allelic origin and 30–50\% to specific isoforms, and we identified substantial differences in isoform usage in different mouse strains and human cell types. Smart-seq3 greatly increased sensitivity compared to Smart-seq2, typically detecting thousands more transcripts per cell. We expect that Smart-seq3 will enable large-scale characterization of cell types and states across tissues and organisms.},

This work constitutes a new step in this direction by proposing a theoretically-grounded method based on neural networks that can leverage interventional data. We illustrate the flexibility of the continuous-constrained framework by taking advantage of expressive neural architectures such as normalizing flows.

Motivated by application impact, we extend this model to heterogeneous, mixed-type data with missing values, allowing for both continuous and discrete treatment decisions.

	abstract = {Self-supervised learning has emerged as a strategy to reduce the reliance on costly supervised signals by pretraining representations only using unlabeled data. These methods combine heuristic proxy classiﬁcation tasks with data augmentations and have achieved signiﬁcant success, but our theoretical understanding of this success remains limited. In this paper we analyze self-supervised representation learning using a causal framework. We show how data augmentations can be more effectively utilized through explicit invariance constraints on the proxy classiﬁers employed during pretraining. Based on this, we propose a novel selfsupervised objective, Representation Learning via Invariant Causal Mechanisms (RELIC), that enforces invariant prediction of proxy targets across augmentations through an invariance regularizer which yields improved generalization guarantees. Further, using causality we generalize contrastive learning, a particular kind of self-supervised method, and provide an alternative theoretical explanation for the success of these methods. Empirically, RELIC signiﬁcantly outperforms competing methods in terms of robustness and out-of-distribution generalization on ImageNet, while also signiﬁcantly outperforming these methods on Atari achieving above human-level performance on 51 out of 57 games.},

Current approaches to VLP heavily rely on image feature extraction processes, most of which involve region supervision (e.g., object detection) and the convolutional architecture (e.g., ResNet). Although disregarded in the literature, we find it problematic in terms of both (1) efficiency/speed, that simply extracting input features requires much more computation than the multimodal interaction steps; and (2) expressive power, as it is upper bounded to the expressive power of the visual embedder and its predefined visual vocabulary. In this paper, we present a minimal VLP model, Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT), monolithic in the sense that the processing of visual inputs is drastically simplified to just the same convolution-free manner that we process textual inputs.

In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer.},

Machine perception models, in stark contrast, are typically modality-specific and optimised for unimodal benchmarks, and hence late-stage fusion of final representations or predictions from each modality (`late-fusion') is still a dominant paradigm for multimodal video classification. Instead, we introduce a novel transformer based architecture that uses `fusion bottlenecks' for modality fusion at multiple layers. Compared to traditional pairwise self-attention, our model forces information between different modalities to pass through a small number of bottleneck latents, requiring the model to collate and condense the most relevant information in each modality and only share what is necessary. We find that such a strategy improves fusion performance, at the same time reducing computational cost. We conduct thorough ablation studies, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple audio-visual classification benchmarks including Audioset, Epic-Kitchens and VGGSound.

	abstract = {Human language is often multimodal, which comprehends a mixture of natural language, facial gestures, and acoustic behaviors. However, two major challenges in modeling such multimodal human language time-series data exist: 1) inherent data non-alignment due to variable sampling rates for the sequences from each modality; and 2) long-range dependencies between elements across modalities. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Transformer (MulT) to generically address the above issues in an end-to-end manner without explicitly aligning the data. At the heart of our model is the directional pairwise crossmodal attention, which attends to interactions between multimodal sequences across distinct time steps and latently adapt streams from one modality to another. Comprehensive experiments on both aligned and non-aligned multimodal time-series show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. In addition, empirical analysis suggests that correlated crossmodal signals are able to be captured by the proposed crossmodal attention mechanism in MulT.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030},
	abstract = {This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with {\textbackslash}textbf\{S\}hifted {\textbackslash}textbf\{win\}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures. The code and models are publicly available at{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}url\{https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer\}.},

Instead, it studies a straightforward, incremental, yet must-know baseline given the recent progress in computer vision: self-supervised learning for Vision Transformers (ViT). While the training recipes for standard convolutional networks have been highly mature and robust, the recipes for ViT are yet to be built, especially in the self-supervised scenarios where training becomes more challenging. In this work, we go back to basics and investigate the effects of several fundamental components for training self-supervised ViT. We observe that instability is a major issue that degrades accuracy, and it can be hidden by apparently good results. We reveal that these results are indeed partial failure, and they can be improved when training is made more stable. We benchmark ViT results in MoCo v3 and several other self-supervised frameworks, with ablations in various aspects. We discuss the currently positive evidence as well as challenges and open questions. We hope that this work will provide useful data points and experience for future research.},

This paper incorporates local feature learning into self-supervised vision transformers via Reconstructive Pre-training (RePre). Our RePre extends contrastive frameworks by adding a branch for reconstructing raw image pixels in parallel with the existing contrastive objective. RePre is equipped with a lightweight convolution-based decoder that fuses the multi-hierarchy features from the transformer encoder. The multi-hierarchy features provide rich supervisions from low to high semantic information, which are crucial for our RePre. Our RePre brings decent improvements on various contrastive frameworks with different vision transformer architectures.

Drawing parallels between linguistic constructs and cellular biology — where texts comprise words, similarly, cells are defined by genes — our study probes the applicability of foundation models to advance cellular biology and genetics research. Utilizing the burgeoning single-cell sequencing data, we have pioneered the construction of a foundation model for single-cell biology, scGPT, which is based on generative pre-trained transformer across a repository of over 33 million cells. Our findings illustrate that scGPT, a generative pre-trained transformer, effectively distills critical biological insights concerning genes and cells. Through the further adaptation of transfer learning, scGPT can be optimized to achieve superior performance across diverse downstream applications.

A significant motivation for these accounts is that scientists frequently use the term ‘mechanism’ in their explanations of biological phenomena. Of course, biologists use a variety of causal concepts in their explanations, including concepts like pathways, cascades, triggers, and processes. Despite this variety, mainstream philosophical views interpret all of these concepts with the single notion of mechanism. In using the mechanism concept interchangeably with other causal concepts, it is not clear that these accounts well capture the diversity of causal structures in biology. This article analyses two causal concepts in biology—the notions of ‘mechanism’ and ‘pathway’—and how they figure in biological explanation. I argue that these concepts have unique features, that they are associated with distinct strategies of causal investigation, and that they figure in importantly different types of explanation.},

Scientists’ concern with objectivity has led to the dominance of associative statistics, which define the basic concept of independence on observations. The same concern with avoiding subjective beliefs has led many scientific journals to favor frequentist over Bayesian statistics. Our analysis here reveals that to infer causes of a binary outcome, (1) the associative definition of independence results in a logical inconsistency -- even for data from an ideal experiment -- for both frequentist and Bayesian statistics, and (2) removing the logical error requires defining independence on counterfactual causal events. The logically coherent causal definition is the one intuitively adopted by humans.

Here, we demonstrate DNA microscopy, a distinct imaging modality for scalable, optics-free mapping of relative biomolecule positions. In DNA microscopy of transcripts, transcript molecules are tagged in situ with randomized nucleotides, labeling each molecule uniquely. A second in situ reaction then ampliﬁes the tagged molecules, concatenates the resulting copies, and adds new randomized nucleotides to uniquely label each concatenation event. An algorithm decodes molecular proximities from these concatenated sequences and infers physical images of the original transcripts at cellular resolution with precise sequence information. Because its imaging power derives entirely from diffusive molecular dynamics, DNA microscopy constitutes a chemically encoded microscopy system.},

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/4gp6c},
	abstract = {Active inference is a leading theory in neuroscience that provides a simple and neuro-biologically plausible account of how action and perception are coupled in producing (Bayes) optimal behaviour; and has been recently used to explain a variety of psychopathological conditions. In parallel, morphogenesis has been described as the behavior of a (non-neural) cellular collective intelligence solving problems in anatomical morphospace. In this article, we establish a link between the domains of cell biology and neuroscience, by analyzing disorders of morphogenesis as disorders of (active) inference. The aim of this article is three-fold. We want to: (i) reveal a connection between disorders of morphogenesis and disorders of active inference as apparent in psychopathological conditions; (ii) show how disorders of morphogenesis can be simulated using active inference; (iii) suggest that active inference can shed light on developmental defects or aberrant morphogenetic processes, seen as disorders of information processing, and perhaps suggesting novel intervention and repair strategies. We present four simulations illustrating application of these ideas to cellular behavior during morphogenesis. Three of the simulations show that the same forms of aberrant active inference (e.g., deficits of sensory attenuation and low sensory precision) that have been used to explain psychopathological conditions (e.g. schizophrenia and autism) also produce familiar disorders of development and morphogenesis when implemented at the level of the collective behavior of a group of cells. The last one presents the effect of the reduction of concentration signaling and sensitivity to the other cells signals of the two cells having a too high precision to treat the development defect. Finally, we present the results of an experimental test of one of the model's predictions in early Xenopus laevis embryos: thioridazine (a dopamine antagonist that may reduce sensory precision in biological systems) induced developmental (anatomical) defects as predicted. The use of conceptual and empirical tools from neuroscience to understand the morphogenetic behavior of pre-neural agents offers the possibility of new approaches in regenerative medicine and evolutionary developmental biology.},

	abstract = {Foundation models are redefining how AI systems are built. Practitioners now follow a standard procedure to build their machine learning solutions: from a pre-trained foundation model, they fine-tune the weights on the target task of interest. So, the Internet is swarmed by a handful of foundation models fine-tuned on many diverse tasks: these individual fine-tunings exist in isolation without benefiting from each other. In our opinion, this is a missed opportunity, as these specialized models contain rich and diverse features. In this paper, we thus propose model ratatouille, a new strategy to recycle the multiple fine-tunings of the same foundation model on diverse auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we repurpose these auxiliary weights as initializations for multiple parallel fine-tunings on the target task; then, we average all fine-tuned weights to obtain the final model. This recycling strategy aims at maximizing the diversity in weights by leveraging the diversity in auxiliary tasks. Empirically, it improves the state of the art on the reference DomainBed benchmark for out-of-distribution generalization. Looking forward, this work contributes to the emerging paradigm of updatable machine learning where, akin to open-source software development, the community collaborates to reliably update machine learning models.},

	abstract = {Computer-aided drug discovery has been around for decades, although the past few years have seen a tectonic shift towards embracing computational technologies in both academia and pharma. This shift is largely defined by the flood of data on ligand properties and binding to therapeutic targets and their 3D structures, abundant computing capacities and the advent of on-demand virtual libraries of drug-like small molecules in their billions. Taking full advantage of these resources requires fast computational methods for effective ligand screening. This includes structure-based virtual screening of gigascale chemical spaces, further facilitated by fast iterative screening approaches. Highly synergistic are developments in deep learning predictions of ligand properties and target activities in lieu of receptor structure. Here we review recent advances in ligand discovery technologies, their potential for reshaping the whole process of drug discovery and development, as well as the challenges they encounter. We also discuss how the rapid identification of highly diverse, potent, target-selective and drug-like ligands to protein targets can democratize the drug discovery process, presenting new opportunities for the cost-effective development of safer and more effective small-molecule treatments.},

Several methods based on docking to study protein complexes have also been well developed over the past few years.

Here, we present an approach called HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven protein−protein Docking) that makes use of biochemical and/or biophysical interaction data such as chemical shift perturbation data resulting from NMR titration experiments or mutagenesis data. This information is introduced as Ambiguous Interaction Restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking process. An AIR is defined as an ambiguous distance between all residues shown to be involved in the interaction. The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated with three molecular complexes. For two of these complexes, for which both the complex and the free protein structures have been solved, NMR titration data were available. Mutagenesis data were used in the last example. In all cases, the best structures generated by HADDOCK, that is, the structures with the lowest intermolecular energies, were the closest to the published structure of the respective complexes (within 2.0 Å backbone RMSD).},

These were merged with default MSAs produced by ColabFold-search and provided to ColabFold-predict. By using SRA data, we achieved highly accurate predictions (GDT\_TS {\textgreater} 70) for 66\% of the non-easy targets, whereas using ColabFold-search default MSAs scored highly in only 52\%. Next, we tested the effect of deep homology search and ColabFold's advanced features, such as more recycles, on prediction accuracy. While SRA homologs were most significant for improving ColabFold's CASP15 ranking from 11th to 3rd place, other strategies contributed too. We analyze these in the context of existing strategies to improve prediction.},

In particular, optimizing compound affinity is a central concern during the early stages of development. In the last 10 years, alchemical free energy (FE) calculations have transformed our ability to incorporate accurate in silico potency predictions in design decisions, and represent the ‘gold standard’ for augmenting experiment-driven drug discovery. However, relative FE calculations are complex to set up, require significant expert intervention to prepare the calculation and analyse the results or are provided only as closed-source software, not allowing for fine-grained control over the underlying settings. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end relative FE workflow based on the non-equilibrium switching approach that facilitates calculation of binding free energies starting from SMILES strings. The workflow is implemented using fully modular steps, allowing various components to be exchanged depending on licence availability. We further investigate the dependence of the calculated free energy accuracy on the initial ligand pose generated by various docking algorithms. We show that both commercial and open-source docking engines can be used to generate poses that lead to good correlation of free energies with experimental reference data.},

            Precision medicine is an approach that takes into account the influence of individuals' genes, environment, and lifestyle exposures to tailor interventions. Here, we describe the development of a robust precision cancer care platform that integrates whole-exome sequencing with a living biobank that enables high-throughput drug screens on patient-derived tumor organoids. To date, 56 tumor-derived organoid cultures and 19 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been established from the 769 patients enrolled in an Institutional Review Board–approved clinical trial. Because genomics alone was insufficient to identify therapeutic options for the majority of patients with advanced disease, we used high-throughput drug screening to discover effective treatment strategies. Analysis of tumor-derived cells from four cases, two uterine malignancies and two colon cancers, identified effective drugs and drug combinations that were subsequently validated using 3-D cultures and PDX models. This platform thereby promotes the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches that can be assessed in clinical trials and provides personalized therapeutic options for individual patients where standard clinical options have been exhausted.

Biol. 7, 17–52 (1964)] quantifies the central evolutionary ideas of inclusive fitness and kin selection into a simple algebraic relationship. Evidence consistent with Hamilton’s rule is found in many animal species. A drawback of investigating Hamilton’s rule in these species is that one can estimate whether a given behavior is consistent with the rule, but a direct examination of the exact cutoff for altruistic behavior predicted by Hamilton is almost impossible. However, to the degree that economic resources confer survival benefits in modern society, Hamilton’s rule may be applicable to economic decision-making, in which case techniques from experimental economics offer a way to determine this cutoff. We employ these techniques to examine whether Hamilton’s rule holds in human decision-making, by measuring the dependence between an experimental subject’s maximal willingness to pay for a gift of \$50 to be given to someone else and the genetic relatedness of the subject to the gift’s recipient. We find good agreement with the predictions of Hamilton’s rule. Moreover, regression analysis of the willingness to pay versus genetic relatedness, the number of years living in the same residence, age, and sex shows that almost all the variation is explained by genetic relatedness. Similar but weaker results are obtained from hypothetical questions regarding the maximal risk to her own life that the subject is willing to take in order to save the recipient’s life.},

            Cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) is a B cell membrane protein that is targeted by monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of malignancies and autoimmune disorders but whose structure and function are unknown. Rituximab (RTX) has been in clinical use for two decades, but how it activates complement to kill B cells remains poorly understood. We obtained a structure of CD20 in complex with RTX, revealing CD20 as a compact double-barrel dimer bound by two RTX antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), each of which engages a composite epitope and an extensive homotypic Fab:Fab interface. Our data suggest that RTX cross-links CD20 into circular assemblies and lead to a structural model for complement recruitment. Our results further highlight the potential relevance of homotypic Fab:Fab interactions in targeting oligomeric cell-surface markers.},

	abstract = {In humans, mutations in BMPR1A, SMAD4 and PTEN are responsible for juvenile polyposis syndrome1, juvenile intestinal polyposis2 and Cowden disease3, respectively. The development of polyposis is a common feature of these diseases, suggesting that there is an association between BMP and PTEN pathways4,5. The mechanistic link between BMP and PTEN pathways and the related etiology of juvenile polyposis is unresolved. Here we show that conditional inactivation of Bmpr1a in mice disturbs homeostasis of intestinal epithelial regeneration with an expansion of the stem and progenitor cell populations, eventually leading to intestinal polyposis resembling human juvenile polyposis syndrome. We show that BMP signaling suppresses Wnt signaling to ensure a balanced control of stem cell self-renewal. Mechanistically, PTEN, through phosphatidylinosital-3 kinase–Akt, mediates the convergence of the BMP and Wnt pathways on control of β-catenin. Thus, BMP signaling may control the duplication of intestinal stem cells, thereby preventing crypt fission and the subsequent increase in crypt number.},

	abstract = {Cellular senescence is characterized by stable cell-cycle arrest and a secretory program that modulates the tissue microenvironment1,2. Physiologically, senescence serves as a tumour-suppressive mechanism that prevents the expansion of premalignant cells3,4 and has a beneficial role in wound-healing responses5,6. Pathologically, the aberrant accumulation of senescent cells generates an inflammatory milieu that leads to chronic tissue damage and contributes to diseases such as liver and lung fibrosis, atherosclerosis, diabetes and osteoarthritis1,7. Accordingly, eliminating senescent cells from damaged tissues in mice ameliorates the symptoms of these pathologies and even promotes longevity1,2,8-10. Here we test the therapeutic concept that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that target senescent cells can be effective senolytic agents. We identify the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)11 as a cell-surface protein that is broadly induced during senescence and show that uPAR-specific CAR T cells efficiently ablate senescent cells in vitro and in vivo. CAR T cells that target uPAR extend the survival of mice with lung adenocarcinoma that are treated with a senescence-inducing combination of drugs, and restore tissue homeostasis in mice in which liver fibrosis is induced chemically or by diet. These results establish the therapeutic potential of senolytic CAR T cells for senescence-associated diseases.},

However, instead of utilizing existing RDBMS solutions they are opting to use a stack of independent solutions for data storage and processing glued together by scripting languages. This is not because they do not need the functionality that an integrated RDBMS provides, but rather because existing RDBMS implementations do not cater to their use case. To solve these issues, we propose a new class of data management systems: embedded analytical systems. These systems are tightly integrated with analytical tools, and provide fast and eﬃcient access to the data stored within them. In this work, we describe the unique challenges and opportunities w.r.t workloads, resilience and cooperation that are faced by this new class of systems and the steps we have taken towards addressing them in the DuckDB system.},

	abstract = {Designing de novo binding proteins against arbitrary epitopes using a single scaffold, as seen with natural antibodies, remains an unsolved challenge in protein design. Current design methods are unable to capture the structural dynamics of flexible loops nor search loop conformational space in a principled way. Here we present Sculptor, a deep generative design algorithm that creates epitope-specific protein binders. The Sculptor algorithm constitutes a joint search over the positions, interactions, and generated conformations of a fold, and crafts a backbone to complement a userspecified epitope. Sequences are designed onto generated backbones using a combination of a residue-wise interaction database, a convolutional sequence design module, and Rosetta. Instead of relying on static structures, we capture the local conformational landscape of a single fold using molecular dynamics, and demonstrate that a model trained on such dense conformational data can generate backbones tailor-fit to an epitope. We use Sculptor to design binders against a conserved epitope on venom toxins implicated in neuromuscular paralysis, and obtain a multi-toxin binder from a small naïve library – a promising step towards creating broadly neutralizing binders. This study constitutes a novel application of deep generative modeling for epitope-targeted design, leveraging conformational dynamics to achieve function.},

With a focus on files produced by the Gromacs MD software, we illustrate the potential offered by the mining of publicly available MD data. We identified systems with specific molecular composition and were able to characterize essential parameters of MD simulation, such as temperature and simulation length, and identify model resolution, such as all-atom and coarse-grain. Based on this analysis, we inferred metadata to propose a search engine prototype to explore collected MD data. To continue in this direction, we call on the community to pursue the effort of sharing MD data, and increase populating and standardizing metadata to reuse this valuable matter.},

All contracts prescribe staged investment decisions to capture the option value associated with the sequential resolution of uncertainty, but the contracts deal with agency problems diﬀerently. Among pre-IPO companies, many alliances resemble venture capital contracts: they involve convertible preferred equity and sometimes contain anti-dilution provisions, warrants, and board seats. Contracts contain explicit provisions linking equity participation to subsequent IPO activity, and contain clauses designed to insulate both parties from multi-tasking problems. Contrary to the standard assumptions of static contract theory, contracts often specify provisions that are unobservable or diﬃcult to verify. Equity participation is positively correlated with the ambiguity of the contracting environment.},

The ligands are typically anchored by binding to a highly conserved asparagine residue. Atypical bromodomains, for which the asparagine is mutated, have thus far proven elusive targets, including PHIP(2) whose parent protein, PHIP, has been linked to disease progression in diabetes and cancers. The PHIP(2) binding site contains a threonine in place of asparagine, and solution screening have yielded no convincing hits. We have overcome this hurdle by combining the sensitivity of X-ray crystallography, used as the primary fragment screen, with a strategy for rapid follow-up synthesis using a chemically-poised fragment library, which allows hits to be readily modified by parallel chemistry both peripherally and in the core. Our approach yielded the first reported hit compounds of PHIP(2) with measurable IC50 values by an AlphaScreen competition assay. The follow-up libraries of four poised fragment hits improved potency into the sub-mM range while showing good ligand efficiency and detailed structural data.},

	abstract = {Druggability assessment of a target protein has emerged in recent years as an important concept in hit-to-lead optimization. A reliable and physically relevant measure of druggability would allow informed decisions on the risk of investing in a particular target. Here, we define “druggability” as a quantitative estimate of binding sites and affinities for a potential drug acting on a specific protein target. In the present study, we describe a new methodology that successfully predicts the druggability and maximal binding affinity for a series of challenging targets, including those that function through allosteric mechanisms. Two distinguishing features of the methodology are (i) simulation of the binding dynamics of a diversity of probe molecules selected on the basis of an analysis of approved drugs and (ii) identification of druggable sites and estimation of corresponding binding affinities on the basis of an evaluation of the geometry and energetics of bound probe clusters. The use of the methodology for a variety of targets such as murine double mutant-2, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, vertebrate kinesin-5 (Eg5), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase provides examples for which the method correctly captures the location and binding affinities of known drugs. It also provides insights into novel druggable sites and the target’s structural changes that would accommodate, if not promote and stabilize, drug binding. Notably, the ability to identify high affinity spots even in challenging cases such as PTP1B or Eg5 shows promise as a rational tool for assessing the druggability of protein targets and identifying allosteric or novel sites for drug binding.},

	abstract = {The conformational flexibility of target proteins continues to be a major challenge in accurate modeling of protein–inhibitor interactions. A fundamental issue, yet to be clarified, is whether the observed conformational changes are controlled by the protein or induced by the inhibitor. Although the concept of induced fit has been widely adopted for describing the structural changes that accompany ligand binding, there is growing evidence in support of the dominance of proteins' intrinsic dynamics which has been evolutionarily optimized to accommodate its functional interactions. The wealth of structural data for target proteins in the presence of different ligands now permits us to make a critical assessment of the balance between these two effects in selecting the bound forms. We focused on three widely studied drug targets, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, p38 MAP kinase, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2. A total of 292 structures determined for these enzymes in the presence of different inhibitors and unbound form permitted us to perform an extensive comparative analysis of the conformational space accessed upon ligand binding, and its relation to the intrinsic dynamics before ligand binding as predicted by elastic network model analysis. Our results show that the ligand selects the conformer that best matches its structural and dynamic properties among the conformers intrinsically accessible to the protein in the unliganded form. The results suggest that simple but robust rules encoded in the protein structure play a dominant role in predefining the mechanisms of ligand binding, which may be advantageously exploited in designing inhibitors.},

Although deep learning approaches have shown potential in generating compounds with desired chemical properties, they disregard the cellular environment of target diseases. Bridging systems biology and drug design, we present a reinforcement learning method for de novo molecular design from gene expression profiles. We construct a hybrid Variational Autoencoder that tailors molecules to target-specific transcriptomic profiles, using an anticancer drug sensitivity prediction model (PaccMann) as reward function. Without incorporating information about anticancer drugs, the molecule generation is biased toward compounds with high predicted efficacy against cell lines or cancer types. The generation can be further refined by subsidiary constraints such as toxicity. Our cancer-type-specific candidate drugs are similar to cancer drugs in drug-likeness, synthesizability, and solubility and frequently exhibit the highest structural similarity to compounds with known efficacy against these cancer types.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have triggered an avalanche of ideas on how to translate such techniques to a variety of domains including the field of drug design. A range of architectures have been devised to find the optimal way of generating chemical compounds by using either graph- or string (SMILES)-based representations. With this application note, we aim to offer the community a production-ready tool for de novo design, called REINVENT. It can be effectively applied on drug discovery projects that are striving to resolve either exploration or exploitation problems while navigating the chemical space. It can facilitate the idea generation process by bringing to the researcher’s attention the most promising compounds. REINVENT’s code is publicly available at https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent.},

The human kinome with its abundant sequence and inhibitor data presents an attractive opportunity to develop proteochemometric models that exploit the size and internal diversity of this family of targets. Here, we challenge a standard practice in sequence-based affinity prediction models: instead of leveraging the full primary structure of proteins, each target is represented by a sequence of 29 discontiguous residues defining the ATP binding site. In kinase–ligand binding affinity prediction, our results show that the reduced active site sequence representation is not only computationally more efficient but consistently yields significantly higher performance than the full primary structure. This trend persists across different models, data sets, and performance metrics and holds true when predicting pIC50 for both unseen ligands and kinases. Our interpretability analysis reveals a potential explanation for the superiority of the active site models: whereas only mild statistical effects about the extraction of three-dimensional (3D) interaction sites take place in the full sequence models, the active site models are equipped with an implicit but strong inductive bias about the 3D structure stemming from the discontiguity of the active sites. Moreover, in direct comparisons, our models perform similarly or better than previous state-of-the-art approaches in affinity prediction. We then investigate a de novo molecular design task and find that the active site provides benefits in the computational efficiency, but otherwise, both kinase representations yield similar optimized affinities (for both SMILES- and SELFIES-based molecular generators). Our work challenges the assumption that the full primary structure is indispensable for modeling human kinases.},

We argue that attention is a principled model of protein interactions, grounded in real properties of protein family data. We introduce an energy-based attention layer, factored attention, which, in a certain limit, recovers a Potts model, and use it to contrast Potts and Transformers. We show that the Transformer leverages hierarchical signal in protein family databases not captured by single-layer models. This raises the exciting possibility for the development of powerful structured models of protein family databases.},

There is emerging evidence that scale may be a key ingredient in scientific deep learning, but the importance of physical priors in scientific domains makes the strategies and benefits of scaling uncertain. Here, we investigate neural scaling behavior in large chemical models by varying model and dataset sizes over many orders of magnitude, studying models with over one billion parameters, pre-trained on datasets of up to ten million datapoints. We consider large language models for generative chemistry and graph neural networks for machine-learned interatomic potentials. To enable large-scale scientific deep learning studies under resource constraints, we develop the Training Performance Estimation (TPE) framework to reduce the costs of scalable hyperparameter optimization by up to 90\%. Using this framework, we discover empirical neural scaling relations for deep chemical models and investigate the interplay between physical priors and scale. Potential applications of large, pre-trained models for "prompt engineering" and unsupervised representation learning of molecules are shown.},

We evaluate computational metrics to assess the quality of enzyme sequences produced by three contrasting generative models: ancestral sequence reconstruction, a generative adversarial network, and a protein language model. Focusing on two enzyme families, we expressed and purified over 440 natural and generated sequences with 70-90\% identity to the most similar natural sequences to benchmark computational metrics for predicting in vitro enzyme activity. Over three rounds of experiments, we developed a computational filter that improved experimental success rates by 44-100\%. Surprisingly, neither sequence identity to natural sequences nor AlphaFold2 residue-confidence scores were predictive of enzyme activity. The proposed metrics and models will drive protein engineering research by serving as a benchmark for generative protein sequence models and helping to select active variants to test experimentally.},

However, these properties impact also their passive membrane permeability. As the “journey” through membranes cannot be monitored experimentally, little is known about the underlying process, which hinders rational design. Here, we use molecular simulations to uncover how cyclic peptides permeate a membrane. We show that side chains can act as “molecular anchors”, establishing the first contact with the membrane and enabling insertion. Once inside, the peptides are positioned between headgroups and lipid tails─a unique polar/apolar interface. Only one of two distinct orientations at this interface allows for the formation of the permeable “closed” conformation. In the closed conformation, the peptide crosses to the lower leaflet via another “anchoring” and flipping mechanism. Our findings provide atomistic insights into the permeation process of flexible cyclic peptides and reveal design considerations for each step of the process.},

Our method enables protein backbone generation using a gradient descent driven hallucination approach and offers orders-of-magnitude efficiency enhancements over previous hallucination approaches. We designed and experimentally produced over 50 proteins, most of which expressed well in E. Coli, were soluble and adopted the desired oligomeric state along with the correct composition of secondary structure as measured by CD. Exemplarily, we determined 3D electron density maps using single-particle cryo EM analysis for three single-chain de-novo proteins comprising 600 AA which closely matched with the designed shape. These have no structural analogues in the protein data bank (PDB), representing potentially novel folds or arrangement of domains. Our approach broadens the scope of de novo protein design and contributes to accessibility to a wider community.},

	abstract = {A general methodology for calculating the equilibrium binding constant of a flexible ligand to a protein receptor is formulated on the basis of potentials of mean force. The overall process is decomposed into several stages that can be computed separately: the free ligand in the bulk is first restrained into the conformation it adopts in the bound state, position, and orientation by applying biasing potentials, then it is translated into the binding site, where it is released completely. The conformational restraining potential is based on the root-mean-square deviation of the peptide coordinates relative to its average conformation in the bound complex. Free energy contributions from each stage are calculated by means of free energy perturbation potential of mean force techniques by using appropriate order parameters. The present approach avoids the need to decouple the ligand from its surrounding (bulk solvent and receptor protein) as is traditionally performed in the double-decoupling scheme. It is believed that the present formulation will be particularly useful when the solvation free energy of the ligand is very large. As an application, the equilibrium binding constant of the phosphotyrosine peptide pYEEI to the Src homology 2 domain of human Lck has been calculated. The results are in good agreement with experimental values.},

              Assessing target occupancy is critical for establishing proof-of-mechanism for novel inhibitors and to determine whether robust target inhibition can be achieved at tolerated doses. This is challenging in the clinic using conventional methods due to the need for untreated controls. We describe a new mass spectrometry approach to quantitatively assess target occupancy for covalent inhibitors that does not require untreated controls, and apply the method to the KRAS

	abstract = {Biological networks are powerful representations for the discovery of molecular phenotypes. Fundamental to network analysis is the principle—rooted in social networks—that nodes that interact in the network tend to have similar properties. While this long-standing principle underlies powerful methods in biology that associate molecules with phenotypes on the basis of network proximity, interacting molecules are not necessarily similar, and molecules with similar properties do not necessarily interact. Here, we show that molecules are more likely to have similar phenotypes, not if they directly interact in a molecular network, but if they interact with the same molecules. We call this the mutual interactor principle and show that it holds for several kinds of molecular networks, including protein-protein interaction, genetic interaction, and signaling networks. We then develop a machine learning framework for predicting molecular phenotypes on the basis of mutual interactors. Strikingly, the framework can predict drug targets, disease proteins, and protein functions in different species, and it performs better than much more complex algorithms. The framework is robust to incomplete biological data and is capable of generalizing to phenotypes it has not seen during training. Our work represents a network-based predictive platform for phenotypic characterization of biological molecules.},

This way of combining individual “expert” models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called “contrastive divergence” whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data.},

	abstract = {Successful drug discovery is like finding oases of safety and efficacy in chemical and biological deserts. Screens in disease models, and other decision tools used in drug research and development (R\&D), point towards oases when they score therapeutic candidates in a way that correlates with clinical utility in humans. Otherwise, they probably lead in the wrong direction. This line of thought can be quantified by using decision theory, in which ‘predictive validity’ is the correlation coefficient between the output of a decision tool and clinical utility across therapeutic candidates. Analyses based on this approach reveal that the detectability of good candidates is extremely sensitive to predictive validity, because the deserts are big and oases small. Both history and decision theory suggest that predictive validity is under-managed in drug R\&D, not least because it is so hard to measure before projects succeed or fail later in the process. This article explains the influence of predictive validity on R\&D productivity and discusses methods to evaluate and improve it, with the aim of supporting the application of more effective decision tools and catalysing investment in their creation.},

However, in recent years, there has been a resurgence in interest in PDD approaches based on their potential to address the incompletely understood complexity of diseases and their promise of delivering first-in-class drugs, as well as major advances in the tools for cell-based phenotypic screening. Nevertheless, PDD approaches also have considerable challenges, such as hit validation and target deconvolution. This article focuses on the lessons learned by researchers engaged in PDD in the pharmaceutical industry and considers the impact of ‘omics’ knowledge in defining a cellular disease phenotype in the era of precision medicine, introducing the concept of a chain of translatability. We particularly aim to identify features and areas in which PDD can best deliver value to drug discovery portfolios and can contribute to the identification and the development of novel medicines, and to illustrate the challenges and uncertainties that are associated with PDD in order to help set realistic expectations with regard to its benefits and costs.},

Out of the 259 agents that were approved, 75 were first-in-class drugs with new MMOAs, and out of these, 50 (67\%) were small molecules and 25 (33\%) were biologics. The results also show that the contribution of phenotypic screening to the discovery of first-in-class small-molecule drugs exceeded that of target-based approaches — with 28 and 17 of these drugs coming from the two approaches, respectively — in an era in which the major focus was on target-based approaches. We postulate that a target-centric approach for first-in-class drugs, without consideration of an optimal MMOA, may contribute to the current high attrition rates and low productivity in pharmaceutical research and development.},

	abstract = {Both common and rare genetic variants influence complex traits and common diseases. Genome-wide association studies have discovered thousands of common-variant associations, and more recently, largescale exome sequencing studies have identified rare-variant associations in hundreds of genes1–3. However, rare-variant genetic architecture is not well characterized, and the relationship between common- and rarevariant architecture is unclear4. Here, we quantify the heritability explained by gene-wise burden of rare coding variants and compare the genetic architecture of common and rare variation across 22 common traits and diseases in 400,000 UK Biobank exomes5. Rare coding variants (AF = 1e-6 - 1e-3) explain 1.3\% (SE = 0.03\%) of phenotypic variance on average – much less than common variants – and most burden heritability is explained by ultra-rare loss-of-function variants (AF = 1e-6 - 1e-5). Common and rare variants implicate the same cell types, with similar enrichments, and they have pleiotropic effects on the same pairs of traits, with similar genetic correlations. They partially colocalize at individual genes and loci, but not to the same extent: burden heritability is strongly concentrated in a limited number of significant genes (median: 6 genes explaining 19\% of h2), while common-variant heritability is much more polygenic. Burden heritability is also more strongly concentrated in constrained genes (median enrichment: 4.5x vs. 2.1x for common variants), indicating that negative selection affects common- and rare-variant architecture differently. Finally, we find that burden heritability for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder6,7 is especially high (3.8\% and 3.6\%). Our results show that there are a tractable number of large-effect genes to discover by studying rare variants, that common and rare associations are mechanistically convergent, and that rare coding variants will contribute only modestly to missing heritability and population risk stratification.},

Because mechanisms that are meant to promote cellular longevity tend to decrease in effectiveness with age, it is no surprise that aging presents as a major risk factor for many diseases such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and diabetes. Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the intracellular antioxidant and overproduction of reactive oxygen species, is known to promote the aging process. Autophagy, a major pathway for protein turnover, is considered as one of the hallmarks of aging. Given the progressive physiologic degeneration and increased risk for disease that accompanies aging, many studies have attempted to discover new compounds that may aid in the reversal of the aging process. Here, we summarize the antiaging mechanism of natural or naturally derived synthetic compounds involving oxidative stress and autophagy. These compounds include: 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) derivatives (synthetic triterpenoids derived from naturally occurring oleanolic acid), caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE, the active ingredient in honey bee propolis), xanthohumol (a prenylated flavonoid identified in the hops plant), guggulsterone (a plant steroid found in the resin of the guggul plant), resveratrol (a natural phenol abundantly found in grape), and sulforaphane (a sulfur-containing compound found in cruciferous vegetables).},

Another boost potential could be applied to the remaining potential energy of the entire system in a dual-boost algorithm (LiGaMD\_Dual) to facilitate ligand binding. LiGaMD has been demonstrated on host-guest and protein-ligand binding model systems. Repetitive guest binding and unbinding in the β-cyclodextrin host were observed in hundreds-of-nanosecond LiGaMD\_Dual simulations. The calculated guest binding free energies agreed excellently with experimental data with {\textless}1.0 kcal/mol errors. Compared with converged microsecond-time scale conventional molecular dynamics simulations, the sampling errors of LiGaMD\_Dual simulations were also {\textless}1.0 kcal/mol. Accelerations of ligand kinetic rate constants in LiGaMD simulations were properly estimated using Kramers' rate theory. Furthermore, LiGaMD allowed us to capture repetitive dissociation and binding of the benzamidine inhibitor in trypsin within 1 μs simulations. The calculated ligand binding free energy and kinetic rate constants compared well with the experimental data. In summary, LiGaMD provides a powerful enhanced sampling approach for characterizing ligand binding thermodynamics and kinetics simultaneously, which is expected to facilitate computer-aided drug design.},

	abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play key roles in many fundamental biological processes such as cellular signaling and immune responses. However, it has proven challenging to simulate repetitive protein association and dissociation in order to calculate binding free energies and kinetics of PPIs, due to long biological timescales and complex protein dynamics. To address this challenge, we have developed a new computational approach to all-atom simulations of PPIs based on a robust Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) technique. The method, termed “PPI-GaMD”, selectively boosts interaction potential energy between protein partners to facilitate their slow dissociation. Meanwhile, another boost potential is applied to the remaining potential energy of the entire system to effectively model the protein’s flexibility and rebinding. PPI-GaMD has been demonstrated on a model system of the ribonuclease barnase interactions with its inhibitor barstar. Six independent 2 μs PPI-GaMD simulations have captured repetitive barstar dissociation and rebinding events, which enable calculations of the protein binding thermodynamics and kinetics simultaneously. The calculated binding free energies and kinetic rate constants agree well with the experimental data. Furthermore, PPI-GaMD simulations have provided mechanistic insights into barstar binding to barnase, which involve long-range electrostatic interactions and multiple binding pathways, being consistent with previous experimental and computational findings of this model system. In summary, PPI-GaMD provides a highly efficient and easy-touse approach for binding free energy and kinetics calculations of PPIs.},

In recent years, progress has primarily focused on parameter count, with recent models’ capacities surpassing the size of the very datasets they were trained on.

We show that large language models trained on codons, instead of amino acid sequences, provide high-quality representations that outperform comparable state-of-the-art models across a variety of tasks. In some tasks, like species recognition, prediction of protein and transcript abundance, or melting point estimation, we show that a language model trained on codons outperforms every other published protein language model, including some that contain over 50 times more parameters. These results suggest that, in addition to commonly studied scale and model complexity, the information content of biological data provides an orthogonal direction to improve the power of machine learning in biology.},

By pretraining on over 110 million prokaryotic gene sequences, and then finetuning a SARS-CoV-2 specific model on 1.5 million genomes, we show that GenSLM can accurately and rapidly identify variants of concern. Thus, to our knowledge, GenSLM represents one of the first whole genome scale foundation models which can generalize to other prediction tasks. We demonstrate the scaling of GenSLMs on both GPU-based supercomputers and AI-hardware accelerators, achieving over 1.54 zettaflops in training runs.

	abstract = {Generating high-resolution, photo-realistic images has been a long-standing goal in machine learning. Recently, Nguyen et al. [37] showed one interesting way to synthesize novel images by performing gradient ascent in the latent space of a generator network to maximize the activations of one or multiple neurons in a separate classiﬁer network. In this paper we extend this method by introducing an additional prior on the latent code, improving both sample quality and sample diversity, leading to a state-of-the-art generative model that produces high quality images at higher resolutions (227 × 227) than previous generative models, and does so for all 1000 ImageNet categories. In addition, we provide a uniﬁed probabilistic interpretation of related activation maximization methods and call the general class of models “Plug and Play Generative Networks.” PPGNs are composed of 1) a generator network G that is capable of drawing a wide range of image types and 2) a replaceable “condition” network C that tells the generator what to draw. We demonstrate the generation of images conditioned on a class (when C is an ImageNet or MIT Places classiﬁcation network) and also conditioned on a caption (when C is an image captioning network). Our method also improves the state of the art of Multifaceted Feature Visualization [40], which generates the set of synthetic inputs that activate a neuron in order to better understand how deep neural networks operate. Finally, we show that our model performs reasonably well at the task of image inpainting. While image models are used in this paper, the approach is modality-agnostic and can be applied to many types of data.},

Our method is the first deep learning-based method that generates antibodies explicitly targeting specific antigen structures and is one of the earliest diffusion probabilistic models for protein structures. The model is a “Swiss Army Knife” capable of sequence-structure co-design, sequence design for given backbone structures, and antibody optimization.

	abstract = {Learning the design patterns of proteins from sequences across evolution may have promise toward generative protein design. However it is unknown whether language models, trained on sequences of natural proteins, will be capable of more than memorization of existing protein families. Here we show that language models generalize beyond natural proteins to generate de novo proteins. We focus on two protein design tasks: fixed backbone design where the structure is specified, and unconstrained generation where the structure is sampled from the model. Remarkably although the models are trained only on sequences, we find that they are capable of designing structure. A total of 228 generated proteins are evaluated experimentally with high overall success rates (152/228 or 67\%) in producing a soluble and monomeric species by size exclusion chromatography. Out of 152 experimentally successful designs, 35 have no significant sequence match to known natural proteins. Of the remaining 117, sequence identity to the nearest sequence match is at median 27\%, below 20\% for 6 designs, and as low as 18\% for 3 designs. For fixed backbone design, the language model generates successful designs for each of eight experimentally evaluated artificially created fixed backbone targets. For unconstrained generation, sampled proteins cover diverse topologies and secondary structure compositions, and have high experimental success rate (71/129 or 55\%). The designs reflect deep patterns linking sequence and structure, including motifs that occur in related natural structures, and motifs that are not observed in similar structural contexts in known protein families. The results show that language models, though only trained on sequences, learn a deep grammar that enables the design of protein structure, extending beyond natural proteins.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2022.12.21.521526},
	abstract = {Combining a basic set of building blocks into more complex forms is a universal design principle. Most protein designs have proceeded from a manual bottom-up approach using parts created by nature, but top-down design of proteins is fundamentally hard due to biological complexity. We demonstrate how the modularity and programmability long sought for protein design can be realized through generative artiﬁcial intelligence. Advanced protein language models demonstrate emergent learning of atomic resolution structure and protein design principles. We leverage these developments to enable the programmable design of de novo protein sequences and structures of high complexity. First, we describe a high-level programming language based on modular building blocks that allows a designer to easily compose a set of desired properties. We then develop an energy-based generative model, built on atomic resolution structure prediction with a language model, that realizes all-atom structure designs that have the programmed properties. Designing a diverse set of speciﬁcations, including constraints on atomic coordinates, secondary structure, symmetry, and multimerization, demonstrates the generality and controllability of the approach. Enumerating constraints at increasing levels of hierarchical complexity shows that the approach can access a combinatorially large design space.},

With the emergence of deep learning and neural generative models in many application areas, models for molecular design based on neural networks appeared recently and show promising results. However, the new models have not been profiled on consistent tasks, and comparative studies to well-established algorithms have only seldom been performed. To standardize the assessment of both classical and neural models for de novo molecular design, we propose an evaluation framework, GuacaMol, based on a suite of standardized benchmarks. The benchmark tasks encompass measuring the fidelity of the models to reproduce the property distribution of the training sets, the ability to generate novel molecules, the exploration and exploitation of chemical space, and a variety of single and multiobjective optimization tasks.

In general, however, live animal drug screening is labor and resource intensive, and has been hampered by the lack of robust assay designs and high throughput work-flows. Based on their small size, tissue transparency and ease of cultivation, the use of C. elegans should obviate many of the technical impediments associated with live animal drug screening. Moreover, their genetic tractability and accomplished record for providing insights into the molecular and cellular basis of human disease, should make C. elegans an ideal model system for in vivo drug discovery campaigns. The goal of this study was to determine whether C. elegans could be adapted to high-throughput and high-content drug screening strategies analogous to those developed for cell-based systems. Using transgenic animals expressing fluorescently-tagged proteins, we first developed a high-quality, high-throughput work-flow utilizing an automated fluorescence microscopy platform with integrated image acquisition and data analysis modules to qualitatively assess different biological processes including, growth, tissue development, cell viability and autophagy. We next adapted this technology to conduct a small molecule screen and identified compounds that altered the intracellular accumulation of the human aggregation prone mutant that causes liver disease in α1-antitrypsin deficiency. This study provides powerful validation for advancement in preclinical drug discovery campaigns by screening live C. elegans modeling α1-antitrypsin deficiency and other complex disease phenotypes on high-content imaging platforms.},

Underpinning this public effort is the largest compound library ever constructed specifically for improving understanding of the chemical basis of toxicity across research and regulatory domains. Each Tox21 federal partner brought specialized resources and capabilities to the partnership, including three approximately equal-sized compound libraries. All Tox21 data generated to date have resulted from a confluence of ideas, technologies, and expertise used to design, screen, and analyze the Tox21 10K library. The different programmatic objectives of the partners led to three distinct, overlapping compound libraries that, when combined, not only covered a diversity of chemical structures, use-categories, and properties but also incorporated many types of compound replicates. The history of development of the Tox21 “10K” chemical library and data workflows implemented to ensure quality chemical annotations and allow for various reproducibility assessments are described. Cheminformatics profiling demonstrates how the three partner libraries complement one another to expand the reach of each individual library, as reflected in coverage of regulatory lists, predicted toxicity end points, and physicochemical properties. ToxPrint chemotypes (CTs) and enrichment approaches further demonstrate how the combined partner libraries amplify structure–activity patterns that would otherwise not be detected. Finally, CT enrichments are used to probe global patterns of activity in combined ToxCast and Tox21 activity data sets relative to test-set size and chemical versus biological end point diversity, illustrating the power of CT approaches to discern patterns in chemical–activity data sets. These results support a central premise of the Tox21 program: A collaborative merging of programmatically distinct compound libraries would yield greater rewards than could be achieved separately.},

Alchemical free energy simulations offer a highly accurate and computationally efficient route to achieving this goal. While the AMBER molecular dynamics package has successfully been used for alchemical free energy simulations in academic research groups for decades, widespread impact in industrial drug discovery settings has been minimal because of the previous limitations within the AMBER alchemical code, coupled with challenges in system setup and postprocessing workflows. Through a close academia-industry collaboration we have addressed many of the previous limitations with an aim to improve accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of alchemical binding free energy simulations in industrial drug discovery applications. Here, we highlight some of the recent advances in AMBER20 with a focus on alchemical binding free energy (BFE) calculations, which are less computationally intensive than alternative binding free energy methods where full binding/unbinding paths are explored. In addition to scientific and technical advances in AMBER20, we also describe the essential practical aspects associated with running relative alchemical BFE calculations, along with recommendations for best practices, highlighting the importance not only of the alchemical simulation code but also the auxiliary functionalities and expertise required to obtain accurate and reliable results. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative BFE simulations in AMBER20, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Protein structures in atomistic detail are essential for a full understanding of biological mechanisms, yet high-resolution structural information remains unavailable for many proteins. Computational structure prediction aims to fill the gap but does not routinely provide models that reach experimental resolution. This study explores the conformational landscape between imperfect structure predictions and correct native experimental structures via molecular dynamics computer simulations. The results presented here demonstrate that structure refinement to experimental accuracy via simulation is indeed possible, but significant challenges are revealed that have to be overcome in practical refinement protocols.
          , 
            Refinement is the last step in protein structure prediction pipelines to convert approximate homology models to experimental accuracy. Protocols based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shown promise, but current methods are limited to moderate levels of consistent refinement. To explore the energy landscape between homology models and native structures and analyze the challenges of MD-based refinement, eight test cases were studied via extensive simulations followed by Markov state modeling. In all cases, native states were found very close to the experimental structures and at the lowest free energies, but refinement was hindered by a rough energy landscape. Transitions from the homology model to the native states require the crossing of significant kinetic barriers on at least microsecond time scales. A significant energetic driving force toward the native state was lacking until its immediate vicinity, and there was significant sampling of off-pathway states competing for productive refinement. The role of recent force field improvements is discussed and transition paths are analyzed in detail to inform which key transitions have to be overcome to achieve successful refinement.},

	abstract = {AlphaFold2 (AF2) has revolutionized structural biology by accurately predicting single structures of proteins and protein-protein complexes. However, biological function is rooted in a protein’s ability to sample different conformational substates, and disease-causing point mutations are often due to population changes of these substates. This has sparked immense interest in expanding AF2’s capability to predict conformational substates. We demonstrate that clustering an input multiple sequence alignment (MSA) by sequence similarity enables AF2 to sample alternate states of known metamorphic proteins, including the circadian rhythm protein KaiB, the transcription factor RfaH, and the spindle checkpoint protein Mad2, and score these states with high confidence. Moreover, we use AF2 to identify a minimal set of two point mutations predicted to switch KaiB between its two states. Finally, we used our clustering method, AF-cluster, to screen for alternate states in protein families without known fold-switching, and identified a putative alternate state for the oxidoreductase DsbE. Similarly to KaiB, DsbE is predicted to switch between a thioredoxin-like fold and a novel fold. This prediction is the subject of future experimental testing. Further development of such bioinformatic methods in tandem with experiments will likely have profound impact on predicting protein energy landscapes, essential for shedding light into biological function.},

When trained on mouse homeodomain PBM profiles, our model correctly identifies residues that confer DNA-binding specificity and accurately predicts binding motifs for an independent set of divergent homeodomains. Similarly, when trained on RNAcompete profiles for diverse RBPs, our model correctly predicts the binding affinities of held-out proteins and identifies key RNA-binding residues, despite the high level of sequence divergence across RBPs.

We also explore the impact of social structure measured by slavery and religion. We then profile the characteristics of inventors and their life cycle finding that inventors were highly educated, positively selected through exit early in their careers, made time allocation decisions such as delayed marriage, and tended to migrate to places that were conducive to innovation. Father's income was positively correlated with becoming an inventor, though not when controlling for the child's education. We show there were strong financial returns to technological development.

We present a novel computational platform named ChemFlow to bridge the gap between 2D chemical libraries and estimated protein–ligand binding affinities.

	abstract = {Small datasets are ubiquitous in drug discovery as data generation is expensive and can be restricted for ethical reasons (e.g. in vivo experiments). A widely applied technique in early drug discovery to identify novel active molecules against a protein target is modeling quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). It is known to be extremely challenging, as available measurements of compound activities range in the low dozens or hundreds. However, many such related datasets exist, each with a small number of datapoints, opening up the opportunity for fewshot learning after pretraining on a substantially larger corpus of data. At the same time, many few-shot learning methods are currently evaluated in the computervision domain. We propose that expansion into a new application, as well as the possibility to use explicitly graph-structured data, will drive exciting progress in few-shot learning. Here, we provide a few-shot learning dataset (FS-Mol) and complementary benchmarking procedure. We deﬁne a set of tasks on which fewshot learning methods can be evaluated, with a separate set of tasks for use in pretraining. In addition, we implement and evaluate a number of existing singletask, multi-task, and meta-learning approaches as baselines for the community. We hope that our dataset, support code release, and baselines will encourage future work on this extremely challenging new domain for few-shot learning.},

	abstract = {DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening and quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling are two techniques used in drug discovery to find novel small molecules that bind a protein target. Applying QSAR modeling to DEL selection data can facilitate the selection of compounds for off-DNA synthesis and evaluation. Such a combined approach has been done recently by training binary classifiers to learn DEL enrichments of aggregated “disynthons” in order to accommodate the sparse and noisy nature of DEL data. However, a binary classification model cannot distinguish between different levels of enrichment, and information is potentially lost during disynthon aggregation. Here, we demonstrate a regression approach to learning DEL enrichments of individual molecules, using a custom negative-log-likelihood loss function that effectively denoises DEL data and introduces opportunities for visualization of learned structure–activity relationships. Our approach explicitly models the Poisson statistics of the sequencing process used in the DEL experimental workflow under a frequentist view. We illustrate this approach on a DEL dataset of 108,528 compounds screened against carbonic anhydrase (CAIX), and a dataset of 5,655,000 compounds screened against soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and SIRT2. Due to the treatment of uncertainty in the data through the negative-log-likelihood loss used during training, the models can ignore low-confidence outliers. While our approach does not demonstrate a benefit for extrapolation to novel structures, we expect our denoising and visualization pipeline to be useful in identifying structure–activity trends and highly enriched pharmacophores in DEL data. Further, this approach to uncertainty-aware regression modeling is applicable to other sparse or noisy datasets where the nature of stochasticity is known or can be modeled; in particular, the Poisson enrichment ratio metric we use can apply to other settings that compare sequencing count data between two experimental conditions.},

	abstract = {The principles of inter-species dose extrapolation are poorly understood and applied. We provide an overview of the principles underlying dose scaling for size and dose adjustment for size-independent differences. Scaling of a dose is required in three main situations: the anticipation of first-in-human doses for clinical trials, dose extrapolation in veterinary practice and dose extrapolation for experimental purposes. Each of these situations is discussed. Allometric scaling of drug doses is commonly used for practical reasons, but can be more accurate when one takes into account species differences in pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance, volume of distribution). Simple scaling of drug doses can be misleading for some drugs; correction for protein binding, physicochemical properties of the drug or species differences in physiological time can improve scaling. However, differences in drug transport and metabolism, and in the dose–response relationship, can override the effect of size alone. For this reason, a range of modelling approaches have been developed, which combine in silico simulations with data obtained in vitro and/or in vivo. Drugs that are unlikely to be amenable to simple allometric scaling of their clearance or dose include drugs that are highly protein-bound, drugs that undergo extensive metabolism and active transport, drugs that undergo significant biliary excretion (MW {\textgreater} 500, ampiphilic, conjugated), drugs whose targets are subject to inter-species differences in expression, affinity and distribution and drugs that undergo extensive renal secretion. In addition to inter-species dose extrapolation, we provide an overview of dose extrapolation within species, discussing drug dosing in paediatrics and in the elderly.},

	abstract = {Three billion years of evolution have produced a tremendous diversity of protein molecules, and yet the full potential of this molecular class is likely far greater. Accessing this potential has been challenging for computation and experiments because the space of possible protein molecules is much larger than the space of those likely to host function. Here we introduce Chroma, a generative model for proteins and protein complexes that can directly sample novel protein structures and sequences and that can be conditioned to steer the generative process towards desired properties and functions. To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process that respects the conformational statistics of polymer ensembles, an efﬁcient neural architecture for molecular systems based on random graph neural networks that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic scaling, equivariant layers for efﬁciently synthesizing 3D structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries, and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion models. We suggest that Chroma can effectively realize protein design as Bayesian inference under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, semantics, and even natural language prompts. With this uniﬁed approach, we hope to accelerate the prospect of programming protein matter for human health, materials science, and synthetic biology.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) can extract clinically actionable information from medical image data. In cancer histopathology, AI can be used to predict the presence of molecular alterations directly from routine histopathology slides. However, training robust AI systems requires large datasets whose collection faces practical, ethical and legal obstacles. These obstacles could be overcome with swarm learning (SL) where partners jointly train AI models, while avoiding data transfer and monopolistic data governance. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate the successful use of SL in large, multicentric datasets of gigapixel histopathology images comprising over 5000 patients. We show that AI models trained using Swarm Learning can predict BRAF mutational status and microsatellite instability (MSI) directly from hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E)-stained pathology slides of colorectal cancer (CRC). We trained AI models on three patient cohorts from Northern Ireland, Germany and the United States of America and validated the prediction performance in two independent datasets from the United Kingdom using SL-based AI models. Our data show that SL enables us to train AI models which outperform most locally trained models and perform on par with models which are centrally trained on the merged datasets. In addition, we show that SL-based AI models are data efficient and maintain a robust performance even if only subsets of local datasets are used for training. In the future, SL can be used to train distributed AI models for any histopathology image analysis tasks, overcoming the need for data transfer and without requiring institutions to give up control of the final AI model.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The extracellular matrix in most tissues is characterized by progressive age-related stiffening and loss of proteolytic digestibility that are accelerated in diabetes and can be duplicated by the nonenzymatic reaction of reducing sugars and extracellular matrix proteins. However, most cross-links of the Maillard reaction described so far are present in quantities too low to account for these changes. Here we have determined in human skin and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) collagen the levels of the recently discovered lysine-arginine cross-links derived from glucose, methylglyoxal, glyoxal, and 3-deoxyglucosone, \textit{i.e.} glucosepane, MODIC, GODIC, and DOGDIC, respectively. Insoluble preparations of skin collagen (\textit{n} = 110) and glomerular basement membrane (GBM, \textit{n} = 28) were enzymatically digested, and levels were measured by isotope dilution technique using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. In skin, all cross-links increased with age (\textit{p} {\textless} 0.0001) except DOGDIC (\textit{p} = 0.34). In nondiabetic controls, levels at 90 years were 2000, 30, and 15 pmol/mg for glucosepane, MODIC, and GODIC, respectively. Diabetes, but not renal failure, increased glucosepane to 5000 pmol/mg (\textit{p} {\textless} 0.0001), and for all others, increased it to {\textless}60 pmol/mg (\textit{p} {\textless} 0.01). In GBMs, glucosepane reached up to 500 pmol/mg of collagen and was increased in diabetes (\textit{p} {\textless} 0.0001) but not old age. In conclusion, glucosepane is the single major cross-link of the senescent extracellular matrix discovered so far, accounting for up to {\textgreater}120 mole\% of triple helical collagen modification in diabetes. Its presence in high quantities may contribute to a number of structural and cell matrix dysfunctions observed in aging and diabetes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we employ a homology eEF2K model, docking and alchemical free energy simulations to probe the binding mechanism of eEF2K, and in turn, guide the optimization of potential lead compounds. The inhibitor was docked into the ATP-binding site of a homology model first. Three different binding poses, hypothesis 1, 2, and 3, were obtained and subsequently applied to molecular dynamics (MD) based alchemical free energy simulations. The calculated relative binding free energy of the analogs of A-484954 using the binding pose of hypothesis 1 show a good correlation with the experimental IC50 values, yielding an r2 coefficient of 0.96 after removing an outlier (compound 5). Calculations using another two poses show little correlation with experimental data, (r2 of less than 0.5 with or without removing any outliers). Based on hypothesis 1, the calculated relative free energy suggests that bigger cyclic groups, at R1 e.g., cyclobutyl and cyclopentyl promote more favorable binding than smaller groups, such as cyclopropyl and hydrogen. Moreover, this study also demonstrates the ability of the alchemical free energy approach in combination with docking and homology modeling to prioritize compound synthesis.

As new methods, force fields, and implementations are developed, assessing their expected accuracy on real-world systems (benchmarking) becomes critical to provide users with an assessment of the accuracy expected when these methods are applied within their domain of applicability, and developers with a way to assess the expected impact of new methodologies. These assessments require construction of a benchmark-a set of well-prepared, high quality systems with corresponding experimental measurements designed to ensure the resulting calculations provide a realistic assessment of expected performance when these methods are deployed within their domains of applicability. To date, the community has not yet adopted a common standardized benchmark, and existing benchmark reports suffer from a myriad of issues, including poor data quality, limited statistical power, and statistically deficient analyses, all of which can conspire to produce benchmarks that are poorly predictive of real-world performance. Here, we address these issues by presenting guidelines for (1) curating experimental data to develop meaningful benchmark sets, (2) preparing benchmark inputs according to best practices to facilitate widespread adoption, and (3) analysis of the resulting predictions to enable statistically meaningful comparisons among methods and force fields. We highlight challenges and open questions that remain to be solved in these areas, as well as recommendations for the collection of new datasets that might optimally serve to measure progress as methods become systematically more reliable. Finally, we provide a curated, versioned, open, standardized benchmark set adherent to these standards (PLBenchmarks) and an open source toolkit for implementing standardized best practices assessments (arsenic) for the community to use as a standardized assessment tool. While our main focus is free energy methods based on molecular simulations, these guidelines should prove useful for assessment of the rapidly growing field of machine learning methods for affinity prediction as well.},

It is shown that SEED allows for consistent computational enrichment of fragment libraries, independent of the effective hit rate. Depending on the actual target protein, true positive rates ranging up to 27\% are observed at a cutoff value corresponding to the experimental hit rate. The impact of variations in docking protocols and energy filters is discussed in detail. Remaining issues, limitations, and use cases of SEED are also discussed. Our results show that fragment library selection or enhancement for a particular target is likely to benefit from docking with SEED, suggesting that SEED is a useful resource for fragment screening campaigns. A workflow is presented for the use of the program in virtual screening, including filtering and postprocessing to optimize hit rates.},

            Currently, there is no accurate method to computationally design peptide binders towards a specific protein interface using only a target structure. Experimental methods such as phage display can produce strong binders, but it is impossible to know where these bind without solving the structures. Using AlphaFold2 (AF) and other AI methods to distinguish true binders has proven highly successful but relies on the availability of binding scaffolds. Here, we develop EvoBind, an
            in silico
            directed-evolution platform based on AF that designs peptide binders towards an interface using only sequence information. We show that AF can distinguish between native and mutated peptide binders using the plDDT score and find that AF adapts the receptor interface structure to the binders during optimisation. We analyse previously designed minibinder proteins and show that AF can distinguish designed binders from non-binders. We compare ELISA ratios of different peptide binders and find the affinity can not be distinguished among binders, possibly due to varying binding sites and low AF confidence. We test the recovery of binding motifs and find that up to 75\% of motifs are recovered. In principle, EvoBind can be used to design binders towards any interface conditioned on if AF can predict these. We expect that EvoBind will aid experimentalists substantially, providing a starting point for further laboratory analysis and optimisation. We hope that the use of AI-based methods will come to make binder design significantly cheaper and more accurate in tackling unmet clinical needs. EvoBind is freely available at:

	abstract = {5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) remains the first-line treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC). Although 5-FU initially de-bulks the tumor mass, recurrence after chemotherapy is the barrier to effective clinical outcomes for CRC patients. Here, we demonstrate that p53 promotes WNT3 transcription, leading to activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway in ApcMin/+/Lgr5EGFP mice, CRC patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) and patient-derived tumor cells (PDCs). Through this regulation, 5-FU induces activation and enrichment of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the residual tumors, contributing to recurrence after treatment. Combinatorial treatment of a WNT inhibitor and 5-FU effectively suppresses the CSCs and reduces tumor regrowth after discontinuation of treatment. These findings indicate p53 as a critical mediator of 5-FU-induced CSC activation via the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and highlight the significance of combinatorial treatment of WNT inhibitor and 5-FU as a compelling therapeutic strategy to improve the poor outcomes of current 5-FU-based therapies for CRC patients.},

	url = {https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eebae70a6aebcc9bcd74e717fed5b655487f1245},
	abstract = {Abstract Motivation The goal of pharmacogenomics is to predict drug response in patients using their single- or multi-omics data. A major challenge is that clinical data (i.e. patients) with drug response outcome is very limited, creating a need for transfer learning to bridge the gap between large pre-clinical pharmacogenomics datasets (e.g. cancer cell lines), as a source domain, and clinical datasets as a target domain. Two major discrepancies exist between pre-clinical and clinical datasets: 1) in the input space, the gene expression data due to difference in the basic biology, and 2) in the output space, the different measures of the drug response. Therefore, training a computational model on cell lines and testing it on patients violates the i.i.d assumption that train and test data are from the same distribution. Results We propose Adversarial Inductive Transfer Learning (AITL), a deep neural network method for addressing discrepancies in input and output space between the pre-clinical and clinical datasets. AITL takes gene expression of patients and cell lines as the input, employs adversarial domain adaptation and multi-task learning to address these discrepancies, and predicts the drug response as the output. To the best of our knowledge, AITL is the first adversarial inductive transfer learning method to address both input and output discrepancies. Experimental results indicate that AITL outperforms state-of-the-art pharmacogenomics and transfer learning baselines and may guide precision oncology more accurately.

	abstract = {Nowadays, users open multiple accounts on social media platforms and e-commerce sites, expressing their personal preferences on different domains. However, users' behaviors change across domains, depending on the content that users interact with, such as movies, music, clothing and retail products. In this paper, we propose an adaptive deep learning strategy for cross-domain recommendation, referred to as ADC. We design a neural architecture and formulate a cross-domain loss function, to compute the non-linearity in user preferences across domains and transfer the knowledge of users' multiple behaviors, accordingly. In addition, we introduce an efficient algorithm for cross-domain loss balancing which directly tunes gradient magnitudes and adapts the learning rates based on the domains' complexities/scales when training the model via backpropagation. In doing so, ADC controls and adjusts the contribution of each domain when optimizing the model parameters. Our experiments on six publicly available cross-domain recommendation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADC model over other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we study the effect of the proposed adaptive deep learning strategy and show that ADC can well balance the impact of the domains with different complexities.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has led to the emergence of many methods for removing systematic technical noises, including imputation methods, which aim to address the increased sparsity observed in single-cell data. Although many imputation methods have been developed, there is no consensus on how methods compare to each other. RESULTS: Here, we perform a systematic evaluation of 18 scRNA-seq imputation methods to assess their accuracy and usability. We benchmark these methods in terms of the similarity between imputed cell profiles and bulk samples and whether these methods recover relevant biological signals or introduce spurious noise in downstream differential expression, unsupervised clustering, and pseudotemporal trajectory analyses, as well as their computational run time, memory usage, and scalability. Methods are evaluated using data from both cell lines and tissues and from both plate- and droplet-based single-cell platforms. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the majority of scRNA-seq imputation methods outperformed no imputation in recovering gene expression observed in bulk RNA-seq. However, the majority of the methods did not improve performance in downstream analyses compared to no imputation, in particular for clustering and trajectory analysis, and thus should be used with caution. In addition, we found substantial variability in the performance of the methods within each evaluation aspect. Overall, MAGIC, kNN-smoothing, and SAVER were found to outperform the other methods most consistently.},

The selection and prioritization of targets is one the the most influential decisions in drug discovery. Here we present a Gaussian Process model for the prioritization of drug targets cast as a problem of learning with only positive and unlabeled examples. RESULTS: Since the absence of negative samples does not allow standard methods for automatic selection of hyperparameters, we propose a novel approach for hyperparameter selection of the kernel in One Class Gaussian Processes. We compare our methods with state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets and then show its application to druggability prediction of oncology drugs. Our score reaches an AUC 0.90 on a set of clinical trial targets starting from a small training set of 102 validated oncology targets. Our score recovers the majority of known drug targets and can be used to identify novel set of proteins as drug target candidates.

	abstract = {Human knowledge provides a formal understanding of the world. Knowledge graphs that represent structural relations between entities have become an increasingly popular research direction towards cognition and human-level intelligence. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of knowledge graph covering overall research topics about 1) knowledge graph representation learning, 2) knowledge acquisition and completion, 3) temporal knowledge graph, and 4) knowledge-aware applications, and summarize recent breakthroughs and perspective directions to facilitate future research. We propose a full-view categorization and new taxonomies on these topics. Knowledge graph embedding is organized from four aspects of representation space, scoring function, encoding models, and auxiliary information. For knowledge acquisition, especially knowledge graph completion, embedding methods, path inference, and logical rule reasoning, are reviewed. We further explore several emerging topics, including meta relational learning, commonsense reasoning, and temporal knowledge graphs. To facilitate future research on knowledge graphs, we also provide a curated collection of datasets and open-source libraries on different tasks. In the end, we have a thorough outlook on several promising research directions.},

Such an approach can not only alleviate the abovementioned issues for a more accurate recommendation, but also provide explanations for recommended items. In this paper, we conduct a systematical survey of knowledge graph-based recommender systems. We collect recently published papers in this field and summarize them from two perspectives. On the one hand, we investigate the proposed algorithms by focusing on how the papers utilize the knowledge graph for accurate and explainable recommendation. On the other hand, we introduce datasets used in these works. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in this field.},

	abstract = {Many cancers feature cellular hierarchies that are driven by tumor-initiating cancer stem cells (CSC) and rely on complex interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Standard cell culture conditions fail to recapitulate the original tumor architecture or microenvironmental gradients and are not designed to retain the cellular heterogeneity of parental tumors. Here, we describe a three-dimensional culture system that supports the long-term growth and expansion of tumor organoids derived directly from glioblastoma specimens, including patient-derived primary cultures, xenografts, genetically engineered glioma models, or patient samples. Organoids derived from multiple regions of patient tumors retain selective tumorigenic potential. Furthermore, organoids could be established directly from brain metastases not typically amenable to in vitro culture. Once formed, tumor organoids grew for months and displayed regional heterogeneity with a rapidly dividing outer region of SOX2(+), OLIG2(+), and TLX(+) cells surrounding a hypoxic core of primarily non-stem senescent cells and diffuse, quiescent CSCs. Notably, non-stem cells within organoids were sensitive to radiotherapy, whereas adjacent CSCs were radioresistant. Orthotopic transplantation of patient-derived organoids resulted in tumors displaying histologic features, including single-cell invasiveness, that were more representative of the parental tumor compared with those formed from patient-derived sphere cultures. In conclusion, we present a new ex vivo model in which phenotypically diverse stem and non-stem glioblastoma cell populations can be simultaneously cultured to explore new facets of microenvironmental influences and CSC biology.

	abstract = {Recent advances in technology have enabled the measurement of RNA levels for individual cells. Compared to traditional tissue-level bulk RNA-seq data, single cell sequencing yields valuable insights about gene expression profiles for different cell types, which is potentially critical for understanding many complex human diseases. However, developing quantitative tools for such data remains challenging because of high levels of technical noise, especially the “dropout” events. A “dropout” happens when the RNA for a gene fails to be amplified prior to sequencing, producing a “false” zero in the observed data. In this paper, we propose a Unified RNA-Sequencing Model (URSM) for both single cell and bulk RNA-seq data, formulated as a hierarchical model. URSM borrows the strength from both data sources and carefully models the dropouts in single cell data, leading to a more accurate estimation of cell type specific gene expression profile. In addition, URSM naturally provides inference on the dropout entries in single cell data that need to be imputed for downstream analyses, as well as the mixing proportions of different cell types in bulk samples. We adopt an empirical Bayes' approach, where parameters are estimated using the EM algorithm and approximate inference is obtained by Gibbs sampling. Simulation results illustrate that URSM outperforms existing approaches both in correcting for dropouts in single cell data, as well as in deconvolving bulk samples. We also demonstrate an application to gene expression data on fetal brains, where our model successfully imputes the dropout genes and reveals cell type specific expression patterns.},

	abstract = {Complex systems often comprise many kinds of components which vary over many orders of magnitude in size: Populations of cities in countries, individual and corporate wealth in economies, species abundance in ecologies, word frequency in natural language, and node degree in complex networks. Comparisons of component size distributions for two complex systems—or a system with itself at two different time points—generally employ information-theoretic instruments, such as Jensen-Shannon divergence. We argue that these methods lack transparency and adjustability, and should not be applied when component probabilities are non-sensible or are problematic to estimate. Here, we introduce `allotaxonometry' along with `rank-turbulence divergence', a tunable instrument for comparing any two (Zipfian) ranked lists of components. We analytically develop our rank-based divergence in a series of steps, and then establish a rank-based allotaxonograph which pairs a map-like histogram for rank-rank pairs with an ordered list of components according to divergence contribution. We explore the performance of rank-turbulence divergence for a series of distinct settings including: Language use on Twitter and in books, species abundance, baby name popularity, market capitalization, performance in sports, mortality causes, and job titles. We provide a series of supplementary flipbooks which demonstrate the tunability and storytelling power of rank-based allotaxonometry.},

Due to the existence of excessive zeros and a large number of small measures, it is challenging to find reliable linear rescaling normalization parameters. We propose a Zipf plot based normalization method (ZN) assuming that all gene profiles have similar upper tail behaviors in their expression distributions. The new normalization method uses global information of all genes in the same profile without gene-level expression alteration. It doesn't require the majority of genes to be not differentially expressed (DE), and can be applied to data where the majority of genes are weakly or not expressed. Two normalization schemes are implemented with ZN: a linear rescaling scheme and a non-linear transformation scheme. The linear rescaling scheme can be applied alone or together with the non-linear normalization scheme. The performance of ZN is benchmarked against five popular linear normalization methods for RNA-seq data. Results show that the linear rescaling normalization scheme by itself works well and is robust. The non-linear normalization scheme can further improve the normalization outcomes and is optional if the Zipf plots show parallel patterns.},

The effectiveness of the triplet loss heavily relies on the triplet selection, in which a common practice is to first sample intra-class patches (positives) from the dataset for batch construction and then mine in-batch negatives to form triplets. For high-informativeness triplet collection, researchers mostly focus on mining hard negatives in the second stage, while paying relatively less attention to constructing informative batches. To alleviate this issue, we propose AdaSample, an adaptive online batch sampler, in this paper. Specifically, hard positives are sampled based on their informativeness. In this way, we formulate a hardness-aware positive mining pipeline within a novel maximum loss minimization training protocol. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated on several standard benchmarks, where it demonstrates a significant and consistent performance gain on top of the existing strong baselines.},

This paper applies these recent ideas to TCGA transcriptomic data on breast and lung cancer. The established cancer subtype organization is well reconstructed in the inferred latent topic structure. Moreover, we identify specific topics that are enriched in genes known to play a role in the corresponding disease and are strongly related to the survival probability of patients. Finally, we show that a simple neural network classifier operating in the low dimensional topic space is able to predict with high accuracy the cancer subtype of a test expression sample.},

	abstract = {We propose an evolutionary perspective to classify and characterize the diverse systems of adaptive immunity that have been discovered across all major domains of life. We put forward a new function-based classification according to the way information is acquired by the immune systems: Darwinian immunity (currently known from, but not necessarily limited to, vertebrates) relies on the Darwinian process of clonal selection to 'learn' by cumulative trial-and-error feedback; Lamarckian immunity uses templated targeting (guided adaptation) to internalize heritable information on potential threats; finally, shotgun immunity operates through somatic mechanisms of variable targeting without feedback. We argue that the origin of Darwinian (but not Lamarckian or shotgun) immunity represents a radical innovation in the evolution of individuality and complexity, and propose to add it to the list of major evolutionary transitions. While transitions to higher-level units entail the suppression of selection at lower levels, Darwinian immunity re-opens cell-level selection within the multicellular organism, under the control of mechanisms that direct, rather than suppress, cell-level evolution for the benefit of the individual. From a conceptual point of view, the origin of Darwinian immunity can be regarded as the most radical transition in the history of life, in which evolution by natural selection has literally re-invented itself. Furthermore, the combination of clonal selection and somatic receptor diversity enabled a transition from limited to practically unlimited capacity to store information about the antigenic environment. The origin of Darwinian immunity therefore comprises both a transition in individuality and the emergence of a new information system - the two hallmarks of major evolutionary transitions. Finally, we present an evolutionary scenario for the origin of Darwinian immunity in vertebrates. We propose a revival of the concept of the 'Big Bang' of vertebrate immunity, arguing that its origin involved a 'difficult' (i.e. low-probability) evolutionary transition that might have occurred only once, in a common ancestor of all vertebrates. In contrast to the original concept, we argue that the limiting innovation was not the generation of somatic diversity, but the regulatory circuitry needed for the safe operation of amplifiable immune responses with somatically acquired targeting. Regulatory complexity increased abruptly by genomic duplications at the root of the vertebrate lineage, creating a rare opportunity to establish such circuitry. We discuss the selection forces that might have acted at the origin of the transition, and in the subsequent stepwise evolution leading to the modern immune systems of extant vertebrates.},

The model quickly adapts when switching among different tissue types and in moving from cell-line models to clinical contexts, including patient-derived tumor cells and patient-derived xenografts. It can also be interpreted to identify the molecular features most important to a drug response, highlighting critical roles for RB1 and SMAD4 in the response to CDK inhibition and RNF8 and CHD4 in the response to ATM inhibition.

Yet, an unaddressed challenge is the development of a method that would directly connect the visual dimension with the molecular phenotype and in particular with the unbiased characterization of proteomes, a close proxy for cellular function. Here we introduce Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP), which combines advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven image analysis of cellular phenotypes with automated single cell laser microdissection and ultra-high sensitivity mass spectrometry7. DVP links protein abundance to complex cellular or subcellular phenotypes while preserving spatial context. Individually excising nuclei from cell culture, we classified distinct cell states with proteomic profiles defined by known and novel proteins. AI also discovered rare cells with distinct morphology, whose potential function was revealed by proteomics. Applied to archival tissue of salivary gland carcinoma, our generic workflow characterized proteomic differences between normal-appearing and adjacent cancer cells, without admixture of background from unrelated cells or extracellular matrix. In melanoma, DVP revealed immune system and DNA replication related prognostic markers that appeared only in specific tumor regions. Thus, DVP provides unprecedented molecular insights into cell and disease biology while retaining spatial information. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement P.H. is the founder and a shareholder of Single-cell technologies Ltd., a biodata analysis company that owns and develops the BIAS software.},

Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Intranasal administration of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission and curtailing pandemic spread.},

Variations can limit the cost, help protect against collusion and aid coordination. We discuss applications to campaign finance, open source software ecosystems, news media finance and urban public projects. More broadly, we relate our mechanism to political theory, discussing how this solution to the public goods problem may furnish neutral and non-authoritarian rules for society that nonetheless support collective organization.},

	abstract = {Because cancer evolution underlies the therapeutic difficulties of cancer, it is clinically important to understand the evolutionary dynamics of cancer. Thus far, a number of evolutionary processes have been proposed to be working in cancer evolution. However, there exists no simulation model that can describe the different evolutionary processes in a unified manner. In this study, we constructed a unified simulation model for describing the different evolutionary processes and performed sensitivity analysis on the model to determine the conditions in which cancer growth is driven by each of the different evolutionary processes. Our sensitivity analysis has successfully provided a series of novel insights into the evolutionary dynamics of cancer. For example, we found that, while a high neutral mutation rate shapes neutral intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) characterized by a fractal-like pattern, a stem cell hierarchy can also contribute to shaping neutral ITH by apparently increasing the mutation rate. Although It has been reported that the evolutionary principle shaping ITH shifts from selection to accumulation of neutral mutations during colorectal tumorigenesis, our simulation revealed the possibility that this evolutionary shift is triggered by drastic evolutionary events that occur in a a short time and confer a marked fitness increase on one or a few cells. This result helps us understand that each process works not separately but simultaneously and continuously as a series of phases of cancer evolution. Collectively, this study serves as a basis to understand in greater depth the diversity of cancer evolution.},

	abstract = {Protein is the primary building block of living organisms. It interacts with other proteins and is then involved in various biological processes. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) help in predicting and hence help in understanding the functionality of the proteins, causes and growth of diseases, and designing new drugs. However, there is a vast gap between the available protein sequences and the identification of protein-protein interactions. To bridge this gap, researchers proposed several computational methods to reveal the interactions between proteins. These methods merely depend on sequence-based information of proteins. With the advancement of technology, different types of information related to proteins are available such as 3D structure information. Nowadays, deep learning techniques are adopted successfully in various domains, including bioinformatics. So, current work focuses on the utilization of different modalities, such as 3D structures and sequence-based information of proteins, and deep learning algorithms to predict PPIs. The proposed approach is divided into several phases. We first get several illustrations of proteins using their 3D coordinates information, and three attributes, such as hydropathy index, isoelectric point, and charge of amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. A pre-trained ResNet50 model, a subclass of a convolutional neural network, is utilized to extract features from these representations of proteins. Autocovariance and conjoint triad are two widely used sequence-based methods to encode proteins, which are used here as another modality of protein sequences. A stacked autoencoder is utilized to get the compact form of sequence-based information. Finally, the features obtained from different modalities are concatenated in pairs and fed into the classifier to predict labels for protein pairs. We have experimented on the human PPIs dataset and Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPIs dataset and compared our results with the state-of-the-art deep-learning-based classifiers. The results achieved by the proposed method are superior to those obtained by the existing methods. Extensive experimentations on different datasets indicate that our approach to learning and combining features from two different modalities is useful in PPI prediction.},

	abstract = {Advancements in sequencing have led to the proliferation of multi-omic profiles of human cells under different conditions and perturbations. In addition, many databases have amassed information about pathways and gene “signatures”-patterns of gene expression associated with specific cellular and phenotypic contexts. An important current challenge in systems biology is to leverage such knowledge about gene coordination to maximize the predictive power and generalization of models applied to high-throughput datasets. However, few such integrative approaches exist that also provide interpretable results quantifying the importance of individual genes and pathways to model accuracy. We introduce AKLIMATE, a first kernel-based stacked learner that seamlessly incorporates multi-omics feature data with prior information in the form of pathways for either regression or classification tasks. AKLIMATE uses a novel multiple-kernel learning framework where individual kernels capture the prediction propensities recorded in random forests, each built from a specific pathway gene set that integrates all omics data for its member genes. AKLIMATE has comparable or improved performance relative to state-of-the-art methods on diverse phenotype learning tasks, including predicting microsatellite instability in endometrial and colorectal cancer, survival in breast cancer, and cell line response to gene knockdowns. We show how AKLIMATE is able to connect feature data across data platforms through their common pathways to identify examples of several known and novel contributors of cancer and synthetic lethality.},

Using machine learning algorithms and based on laboratory blood test results, we have built two models to predict a haematologic disease. One predictive model used all the available blood test parameters and the other used only a reduced set that is usually measured upon patient admittance. Both models produced good results, obtaining prediction accuracies of 0.88 and 0.86 when considering the list of five most likely diseases and 0.59 and 0.57 when considering only the most likely disease. The models did not differ significantly, which indicates that a reduced set of parameters can represent a relevant “fingerprint” of a disease. This knowledge expands the model's utility for use by general practitioners and indicates that blood test results contain more information than physicians generally recognize. A clinical test showed that the accuracy of our predictive models was on par with that of haematology specialists. Our study is the first to show that a machine learning predictive model based on blood tests alone can be successfully applied to predict haematologic diseases.

However, especially among vertebrates, aging also promotes hyperplastic pathologies, the most deadly of which is cancer. In contrast to the loss of function that characterizes degenerating cells and tissues, malignant (cancerous) cells must acquire new (albeit aberrant) functions that allow them to develop into a lethal tumor. This review discusses the idea that, despite seemingly opposite characteristics, the degenerative and hyperplastic pathologies of aging are at least partly linked by a common biological phenomenon: a cellular stress response known as cellular senescence. The senescence response is widely recognized as a potent tumor suppressive mechanism. However, recent evidence strengthens the idea that it also drives both degenerative and hyperplastic pathologies, most likely by promoting chronic inflammation. Thus, the senescence response may be the result of antagonistically pleiotropic gene action.},

	abstract = {Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.},

Recent advances in the development of small-molecule degraders, including molecular glues and heterobifunctional degraders such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), have made it possible to target many proteins that were previously considered undruggable. In particular, PROTACs form a ternary complex with a hijacked E3 ubiquitin ligase and a target protein, leading to polyubiquitination and degradation of the target protein. The broad applicability of this approach is facilitated by the flexibility of individual E3 ligases to recognize different substrates. The vast majority of the approximately 600 human E3 ligases have not been explored, thus presenting enormous opportunities to develop degraders that target oncoproteins with tissue, tumour and subcellular selectivity. In this Review, we first discuss the molecular basis of targeted protein degradation. We then offer a comprehensive account of the most promising degraders in development as cancer therapies to date.

However, it is difficult to expand the large numbers of highly pure NK cells from CB without cell sorting and feeder cells/multiple cytokines. In this study, we try to develop a simple, safe and economical method for ex vivo expansion and purification of NK cells from CB without cell sorting and feeder cells/multiple cytokines. RESULTS: The large numbers (mean: 1.59 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 1010) of highly pure (\${\textbackslash}geq\$90\%) NK cells from CB could be obtained through interleukin-2, group A streptococcus and zoledronate stimulation of mononuclear cells using the 21-day culture approach. When compared to resting NK cells, expanded NK cells were a higher expression of activating receptors CD16, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46 and activating markers CD62L and CD69, while the inhibitory receptors, CD158a and CD158b remained largely unchanged. In addition, these cells showed a higher concentration of IFN-γ, TNF-α and GM-CSF secretion and cytotoxicity to K562 cells and acute myeloid leukemia targets than resting NK cells. CONCLUSION: We develop a simple, safe and economical method to obtain high yield, purity, and functionality NK cells from CB without cell sorting and feeder cells/multiple cytokines.},

	abstract = {Molecular docking has been successfully used in computer-aided molecular design projects for the identification of ligand poses within protein binding sites. However, relying on docking scores to rank different ligands with respect to their experimental affinities might not be sufficient. It is believed that the binding scores calculated using molecular mechanics combined with the Poisson-Boltzman surface area (MM-PBSA) or generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) can predict binding affinities more accurately. In this perspective, we decided to take part in Stage 2 of the Drug Design Data Resource (D3R) Grand Challenge 4 (GC4) to compare the performance of a quick scoring function, AutoDock4, to that of MM-GBSA in predicting the binding affinities of a set of [Formula: see text]-Amyloid Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE-1) ligands. Our results show that re-scoring docking poses using MM-GBSA did not improve the correlation with experimental affinities. We further did a retrospective analysis of the results and found that our MM-GBSA protocol is sensitive to details in the protein-ligand system: (i) neutral ligands are more adapted to MM-GBSA calculations than charged ligands, (ii) predicted binding affinities depend on the initial conformation of the BACE-1 receptor, (iii) protonating the aspartyl dyad of BACE-1 correctly results in more accurate binding affinity predictions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cost per patient of next generation sequencing for detection of rare mutations may be significantly reduced using pooled experiments. Recently, some techniques have been proposed for the planning of pooled experiments and for the optimal allocation of patients into pools. However, the lack of a user friendly resource for planning the design of pooled experiments forces the scientists to do frequent, complex and long computations. RESULTS: OPENDoRM is a powerful collection of novel mathematical algorithms usable via an intuitive graphical user interface. It enables researchers to speed up the planning of their routine experiments, as well as, to support scientists without specific bioinformatics expertises. Users can automatically carry out analysis in terms of costs associated with the optimal allocation of patients in pools. They are also able to choose between three distinct pooling mathematical methods, each of which also suggests the optimal configuration for the submitted experiment. Importantly, in order to keep track of the performed experiments, users can save and export the results of their experiments in standard tabular and charts contents. CONCLUSION: OPENDoRM is a freely available web-oriented application for the planning of pooled NGS experiments, available at: http://www-labgtp.na.icar.cnr.it/OPENDoRM. Its easy and intuitive graphical user interface enables researchers to plan theirs experiments using novel algorithms, and to interactively visualize the results.},

In this format, multiple novel paratopes against different tumor antigens were able to recruit T-cell cytotoxicity to tumor cells in vitro and in an in vivo pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma xenograft model. Since unique surface antigens in solid tumors are limited, in order to enhance selectivity, we further engineered “double-DATEs” targeting two tumor antigens simultaneously. The double-DATE contains an additional autonomous variable heavy-chain domain, which binds a second tumor antigen without itself eliciting a cytotoxic response. This novel modality provides a strategy to enhance the selectivity of immune redirection through binary targeting of native tumor antigens. The modularity and use of a common, stable human framework for all components enables a pipeline approach to rapidly develop a broad repertoire of tailored DATEs and double-DATEs with favorable biophysical properties and high potencies and selectivities.},

	abstract = {The rampant spread of COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, all over the world has led to over millions of deaths, and devastated the social, financial and political entities around the world. Without an existing effective medical therapy, vaccines are urgently needed to avoid the spread of this disease. In this study, we propose an in silico deep learning approach for prediction and design of a multi-epitope vaccine (DeepVacPred). By combining the in silico immunoinformatics and deep neural network strategies, the DeepVacPred computational framework directly predicts 26 potential vaccine subunits from the available SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence. We further use in silico methods to investigate the linear B-cell epitopes, Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes, Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes in the 26 subunit candidates and identify the best 11 of them to construct a multi-epitope vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus. The human population coverage, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, physicochemical properties and secondary structure of the designed vaccine are evaluated via state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches, showing good quality of the designed vaccine. The 3D structure of the designed vaccine is predicted, refined and validated by in silico tools. Finally, we optimize and insert the codon sequence into a plasmid to ensure the cloning and expression efficiency. In conclusion, this proposed artificial intelligence (AI) based vaccine discovery framework accelerates the vaccine design process and constructs a 694aa multi-epitope vaccine containing 16 B-cell epitopes, 82 CTL epitopes and 89 HTL epitopes, which is promising to fight the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and can be further evaluated in clinical studies. Moreover, we trace the RNA mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 and ensure that the designed vaccine can tackle the recent RNA mutations of the virus.},

A major challenge in such approaches is a loss of stem cell potency during culture. Here we describe an artificial niche for maintaining muscle stem cells (MuSCs) in vitro in a potent, quiescent state. Using a machine learning method, we identified a molecular signature of quiescence and used it to screen for factors that could maintain mouse MuSC quiescence, thus defining a quiescence medium (QM). We also engineered muscle fibers that mimic the native myofiber of the MuSC niche. Mouse MuSCs maintained in QM on engineered fibers showed enhanced potential for engraftment, tissue regeneration and self-renewal after transplantation in mice. An artificial niche adapted to human cells similarly extended the quiescence of human MuSCs in vitro and enhanced their potency in vivo. Our approach for maintaining quiescence may be applicable to stem cells isolated from other tissues.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models used in pre-clinical drug discovery tend to be empirical growth laws. Such models are well suited to fitting the data available, mostly longitudinal studies of tumour volume, however, they typically have little connection with the underlying physiological processes. This lack of a mechanistic underpinning restricts their flexibility and inhibits their direct translation across studies including from animal to human. Here we present a mathematical model describing tumour growth for the evaluation of single agent cytotoxic compounds that is based on mechanistic principles. The model can predict spatial distributions of cell subpopulations and account for spatial drug distribution effects within tumours. Importantly, we demonstrate the model can be reduced to a growth law similar in form to the ones currently implemented in pharmaceutical drug development for pre-clinical trials so that it can integrated into the current workflow. We validate this approach for both cell-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) data. This shows that our theoretical model fits as well as the best performing and most widely used models. However, in addition the model is also able to accurately predict the observed growing fraction of tumours. Our work opens up current pre-clinical modelling studies to also incorporating spatially resolved and multi-modal data without significant added complexity and creates the opportunity to improve translation and tumour response predictions. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement James Yates was a paid employee of AstraZeneca.

The proposed airburst was larger than the 1908 explosion over Tunguska, Russia, where a 50-m-wide bolide detonated with 1000\${\textbackslash}times\$ more energy than the Hiroshima atomic bomb. A city-wide 1.5-m-thick carbon-and-ash-rich destruction layer contains peak concentrations of shocked quartz ( 5–10 GPa); melted pottery and mudbricks; diamond-like carbon; soot; Fe- and Si-rich spherules; CaCO3 spherules from melted plaster; and melted platinum, iridium, nickel, gold, silver, zircon, chromite, and quartz. Heating experiments indicate temperatures exceeded 2000 °C. Amid city-side devastation, the airburst demolished 12+ m of the 4-to-5-story palace complex and the massive 4-m-thick mudbrick rampart, while causing extreme disarticulation and skeletal fragmentation in nearby humans. An airburst-related influx of salt ( 4 wt.\%) produced hypersalinity, inhibited agriculture, and caused a 300–600-year-long abandonment of 120 regional settlements within a {\textgreater} 25-km radius. Tall el-Hammam may be the second oldest city/town destroyed by a cosmic airburst/impact, after Abu Hureyra, Syria, and possibly the earliest site with an oral tradition that was written down (Genesis).

	abstract = {The functional and structural resemblance of organoids to mammalian organs suggests that they might follow the same allometric scaling rules. However, despite their remarkable likeness to downscaled organs, non-luminal organoids are often reported to possess necrotic cores due to oxygen diffusion limits. To assess their potential as physiologically relevant in vitro models, we determined the range of organoid masses in which quarter power scaling as well as a minimum threshold oxygen concentration is maintained. Using data on brain organoids as a reference, computational models were developed to estimate oxygen consumption and diffusion at different stages of growth. The results show that mature brain (or other non-luminal) organoids generated using current protocols must lie within a narrow range of masses to maintain both quarter power scaling and viable cores. However, micro-fluidic oxygen delivery methods could be designed to widen this range, ensuring a minimum viable oxygen threshold throughout the constructs and mass dependent metabolic scaling. The results provide new insights into the significance of the allometric exponent in systems without a resource-supplying network and may be used to guide the design of more predictive and physiologically relevant in vitro models, providing an effective alternative to animals in research.},

	abstract = {We addressed the precursor role of aging-like spontaneous promoter DNA hypermethylation in initiating tumorigenesis. Using mouse colon-derived organoids, we show that promoter hypermethylation spontaneously arises in cells mimicking the human aging-like phenotype. The silenced genes activate the Wnt pathway, causing a stem-like state and differentiation defects. These changes render aged organoids profoundly more sensitive than young ones to transformation by BrafV600E, producing the typical human proximal BRAFV600E-driven colon adenocarcinomas characterized by extensive, abnormal gene-promoter CpG-island methylation, or the methylator phenotype (CIMP). Conversely, CRISPR-mediated simultaneous inactivation of a panel of the silenced genes markedly sensitizes to BrafV600E-induced transformation. Our studies tightly link aging-like epigenetic abnormalities to intestinal cell fate changes and predisposition to oncogene-driven colon tumorigenesis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A quantitative trait is controlled both by major variants with large genetic effects and by minor variants with small effects. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are an efficient approach to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL), and genomic selection (GS) with high-density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can achieve higher accuracy of estimated breeding values than conventional best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP). GWAS and GS address different aspects of quantitative traits, but, as statistical models, they are quite similar in their description of the genetic mechanisms that underlie quantitative traits. METHODS: Here, we propose a stepwise linear regression mixed model (StepLMM) to unify GWAS and GS in a single statistical model. First, the variance components of the genomic-BLUP (GBLUP) model are estimated. Then, in the SNP selection step, the linear mixed model (LMM) for GWAS is equivalently transformed into a simple linear regression to improve computation speed, and the most significant SNP is selected and included into the evaluation model. In the SNP dropping step, the SNPs in the evaluation model are tested according to the standard errors of their estimated effects. If non-significant SNPs are present, the least significant one is dropped from the model and variance components are re-estimated. We used extended Bayesian information criteria (eBIC) to evaluate the model optimization, i.e. the model with the smallest eBIC is the final one and includes only significant SNPs. RESULTS: We simulated scenarios with different heritabilities with 100 QTL. StepLMM estimated heritability accurately and mapped QTL precisely. Genomic prediction accuracy was much higher with StepLMM than with GBLUP. The comparison of StepLMM with other GWAS and GS methods based on a dataset from the 16th QTLMAS Workshop showed that StepLMM had medium mapping power, the lowest rate of false positives for QTL mapping, and the highest accuracy for genomic prediction. CONCLUSIONS: StepLMM is a combination of GWAS and GBLUP. GWAS and GBLUP are beneficial to each other in a single statistical model, GWAS improves genomic prediction accuracy, while GBLUP increases mapping precision and decreases the rate of false positives of GWAS. StepLMM has a high performance in both GWAS and GS and is feasible for agricultural breeding programs and human genetic studies.},

In the present study, we examined the mechanism of age-dependent IL-6 overproduction using visceral white adipose tissue from C57BL/6 mice. Upon treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro, IL-6 was produced by adipose tissue explants, and secreted levels were significantly higher in cultures from aged (24 months) mice compared to young (4 months). Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), two inducers of IL-6, were mainly produced by the lungs and spleen rather than adipose tissue in mice after LPS injection. Treatment of adipose explants with physiological levels of IL-1β induced significant age-dependent secretion of IL-6, while treatment with TNFα had little effect, demonstrating an augmented response of adipose tissues to IL-1β in the aged. In vitro experiments utilizing a neutralizing antibody against IL-1β and in vivo experiments utilizing IL-1-receptor-1 deficient mice, confirmed that IL-6 overproduction in the aged is regulated by autocrine/paracrine action of IL-1β which specifically occurs in aged adipose tissues. These findings indicate an elevated inflammatory potential of adipose tissue in the aged and a unique IL-1β-mediated mechanism for IL-6 overproduction, which may impact age-associated vulnerability to acute inflammatory diseases such as sepsis.},

Because of the difficulty of assessing HR in mammals, little is known about HR activity in mammalian tissues or about the effects of cancer risk factors on HR in vivo. To study HR in vivo, we have used fluorescent yellow direct repeat mice, in which an HR event at a transgene yields a fluorescent phenotype. Results show that HR is an active pathway in the pancreas throughout life, that HR is induced in vivo by exposure to a cancer chemotherapeutic agent, and that recombinant cells accumulate with age in pancreatic tissue. Furthermore, we developed an in situ imaging approach that reveals an increase in both the frequency and the sizes of isolated recombinant cell clusters with age, indicating that both de novo recombination events and clonal expansion contribute to the accumulation of recombinant cells with age. This work demonstrates that aging and exposure to a cancer chemotherapeutic agent increase the frequency of recombinant cells in the pancreas, and it also provides a rapid method for revealing additional factors that modulate HR and clonal expansion in vivo.},

Here we show that these agents activate the DNA damage response (DDR) kinases ATM and DNA-PKcs through the generation of double stranded breaks (DSBs) in murine macrophage genomic DNA. In contrast to other cell types, initiation of this DDR depends on signaling from the type I interferon receptor. Once activated, ATM and DNA-PKcs regulate a genetic program with diverse immune functions and promote inflammasome activation and the production of IL-1β and IL-18. Indeed, following infection with Listeria monocytogenes, DNA-PKcs-deficient murine macrophages produce reduced levels of IL-18 and are unable to optimally stimulate IFN-γ production by NK cells. Thus, genomic DNA DSBs act as signaling intermediates in murine macrophages, regulating innate immune responses through the initiation of a type I IFN-dependent DDR.},

	abstract = {The Hippo pathway is involved in the regulation of contact inhibition of proliferation and responses to various physical and chemical stimuli. Recently, several upstream negative regulators of Hippo signaling, including epidermal growth factor receptor ligands and lysophosphatidic acid, have been identified. We show that fibronectin adhesion stimulation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-Src signaling is another upstream negative regulator of the Hippo pathway. Inhibition of FAK or Src in MCF-10A cells plated at low cell density prevented the activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in a large tumor suppressor homologue (Lats)-dependent manner. Attachment of serum-starved MCF-10A cells to fibronectin, but not poly-d-lysine or laminin, induced YAP nuclear accumulation via the FAK-Src-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Attenuation of FAK, Src, PI3K, or PDK1 activity blocked YAP nuclear accumulation stimulated by adhesion to fibronectin. This negative regulation of the Hippo pathway by fibronectin adhesion signaling can, at least in part, explain the effects of cell spreading on YAP nuclear localization and represents a Lats-dependent component of the response to cell adhesion.},

Using antisera reactive either with total ERK or with phosphorylated/activated forms of ERK, in rat embryo fibroblasts and embryonic avian cells that express v-Src, we found that active ERK is targeted to newly forming focal adhesions after integrin engagement or activation of v-Src. UO126, an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), suppressed focal adhesion targeting of active ERK and cell spreading. Also, integrin engagement and v-Src induced myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chain downstream of the MEK/ERK pathway, and MLCK and myosin activities are required for the focal adhesion targeting of ERK. The translocation of active ERK to newly forming focal adhesions may direct specificity towards appropriate downstream targets that influence adhesion assembly. These findings support a role for ERK in the regulation of the adhesion/cytoskeletal network and provide an explanation for the role of ERK in cell motility.},

We now show that AKT inhibition induces the expression and phosphorylation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). In a wide spectrum of tumor types, inhibition of AKT induces a conserved set of RTKs, including HER3, IGF-1R, and insulin receptor. This is in part due to mTORC1 inhibition and in part secondary to a FOXO-dependent activation of receptor expression. PI3K-AKT inhibitors relieve this feedback and activate RTK signaling; this may attenuate their antitumor activity. Consistent with this model, we find that, in tumors in which AKT suppresses HER3 expression, combined inhibition of AKT and HER kinase activity is more effective than either alone.},

We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects.

However, the limited availability of rapid, flexible imaging and analysis platforms has limited the use of zebrafish in drug screens.

We utilised the WiScan® Hermes High Content Imaging System to rapidly acquire brightfield and fluorescent images of embryos, and the WiSoft® Athena Zebrafish Application for analysis, which harnesses an Artificial Intelligence-driven algorithm to automatically detect fish in brightfield images, identify anatomical structures, partition the animal into regions and exclusively select the desired side-oriented fish. Our initial validation combined structural analysis with fluorescence images to enumerate GFP-tagged haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the tails of embryos, which correlated with manual counts. We further validated this system to assess the effects of genetic mutations and X-ray irradiation in high content using a wide range of assays. Further, we performed simultaneous analysis of multiple cell types using dual fluorophores in high throughput. In summary, we demonstrate a broadly applicable and rapidly customisable platform for high-content screening in zebrafish.

Using whole-genome DNA and RNA sequencing analyses, as well as medium-throughput drug sensitivity testing and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we demonstrate that cancer organoids grown as a suspension culture are genetically and phenotypically similar to their counterparts grown in standard conditions.

To elucidate pathways in peripheral immune cells that might lead to immunopathology or protective immunity in severe COVID-19, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from seven patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four of whom had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and six healthy controls. We identify reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotype in COVID-19, including a heterogeneous interferon-stimulated gene signature, HLA class II downregulation and a developing neutrophil population that appears closely related to plasmablasts appearing in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Importantly, we found that peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes do not express substantial amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

According to this metaphor, nature has a certain goal or purpose, the perpetuation of the species, or, alternatively, the reproductive success of the individual. In relation to this goal, the individual organism has a function, job, or task, namely, to breed and, in some species, to raise its brood to maturity. On this picture, those who cannot, or can no longer, reproduce are somehow invisible to, or even dispensable to, the evolutionary process. Here, I argue that the metaphor should be discarded, not on the grounds that it is a metaphor, but on the grounds that this particular metaphor distorts our understanding of the evolution of ageing. One reason the metaphor is problematic is that it frames senescence and death as nature's verdict on the value of older individuals. Instead, we should explore a different metaphor: the lengthy post-reproductive period in humans and some other animals is not an accident of culture, but designed by nature for the purpose of supporting and guiding younger generations. On this alternate picture, different stages of life have their own evolutionary rationales, their distinctive design features, their special mandates.},

	abstract = {The development of genetic tools allowed for the validation of the pro-aging and pro-disease functions of senescent cells in vivo. These discoveries prompted the development of senotherapies-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at interfering with the detrimental effect of senescent cells-that are now entering the clinical stage. However, unequivocal identification and examination of cellular senescence remains highly difficult because of the lack of universal and specific markers. Here, to overcome the limitation of measuring individual markers, we describe a detailed two-phase algorithmic assessment to quantify various senescence-associated parameters in the same specimen. In the first phase, we combine the measurement of lysosomal and proliferative features with the expression of general senescence-associated genes to validate the presence of senescent cells. In the second phase we measure the levels of pro-inflammatory markers for specification of the type of senescence. The protocol can help graduate-level basic scientists to improve the characterization of senescence-associated phenotypes and the identification of specific senescent subtypes. Moreover, it can serve as an important tool for the clinical validation of the role of senescent cells and the effectiveness of anti-senescence therapies.},

	abstract = {Human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) are relics of ancient retroviral infections in our genome. Most of them have lost their coding capacity, but proviral RNA or protein have been observed in several disease states (e.g. in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and malignancies). However, their clinical significance as well as their mechanisms of action have still remained elusive. As human aging is associated with several biological characteristics of these diseases, we now analyzed the aging-associated expression of the individual proviruses of two HERV families, HERV-K (91 proviruses) and HERV-W (213 proviruses) using genome-wide RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). RNA was purified from blood cells derived from healthy young individuals (n = 7) and from nonagenarians (n = 7). The data indicated that in the case of HERV-K (HML-2) 33 proviruses had a detectable expression but in only 3 of those the expression levels were significantly different between the young and old individuals. In the HERV-W family expression was observed in 45 loci and only in one case the young/old difference was significant. However, applying hierarchical clustering on the HERV expression data resulted in the formation of two distinct clusters, one containing the young individuals and another the nonagenarians. This suggests, that even though the aging-associated differences in the expression levels of individual proviruses are minor, there seems to be some underlying aging-related pattern. These data indicate that aging does not have a strong effect on the expression of individual HERV proviruses, but instead several proviruses are affected moderately, leading to age-dependent expression profiles.},

Here, we used theoretical considerations and experimental models of immune responses in vitro and in vivo to quantify the spatial extent of cytokine communications in dense tissues. We established that competition between cytokine diffusion and consumption generated spatial niches of high cytokine concentrations with sharp boundaries. The size of these self-assembled niches scaled with the density of cytokine-consuming cells, a parameter that gets tuned during immune responses. In vivo, we measured interactions on length scales of 80-120 μm, which resulted in a high degree of cell-to-cell variance in cytokine exposure. Such heterogeneous distributions of cytokines were a source of non-genetic cell-to-cell variability that is often overlooked in single-cell studies. Our findings thus provide a basis for understanding variability in the patterning of immune responses by diffusible factors.},

Although researchers have made rapid progress in developing geroprotective interventions that target mechanisms of aging and delay or prevent the onset of multiple concurrent age-related diseases, a lack of standardized techniques to assess healthspan in preclinical murine studies has resulted in reduced reproducibility and slow progress. To overcome this, major centers in Europe and the United States skilled in healthspan analysis came together to agree on a toolbox of techniques that can be used to consistently assess the healthspan of mice. Here, we describe the agreed toolbox, which contains protocols for echocardiography, novel object recognition, grip strength, rotarod, glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT), body composition, and energy expenditure. The protocols can be performed longitudinally in the same mouse over a period of 4-6 weeks to test how candidate geroprotectors affect cardiac, cognitive, neuromuscular, and metabolic health.},

However, the transgenic methods used for delivering reprogramming factors have raised concerns regarding the future utility of the resulting stem cells. These uncertainties could be overcome if each transgenic factor were replaced with a small molecule that either directly activated its expression from the somatic genome or in some way compensated for its activity. To this end, we have used high-content chemical screening to identify small molecules that can replace Sox2 in reprogramming. We show that one of these molecules functions in reprogramming by inhibiting Tgf-beta signaling in a stable and trapped intermediate cell type that forms during the process. We find that this inhibition promotes the completion of reprogramming through induction of the transcription factor Nanog.},

Here, we developed a microfluidic device to monitor the dynamics of cell division and ΔΨ in real time at single-cell resolution. We show that cells do not enter senescence gradually but rather undergo an abrupt transition to a slowly dividing state. Moreover, we demonstrate that the decline in ΔΨ, which is observed only in a fraction of cells, is not responsible for entry into senescence. Rather, the loss of ΔΨ is an age-independent and heritable process that leads to clonal senescence and is therefore incompatible with daughter cell rejuvenation.

Remarkably, nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), which inhibit L1 retrotransposition, significantly improved health and lifespan of SIRT6 knockout mice and completely rescued type I interferon response. In tissue culture, inhibition of L1 with siRNA or NRTIs abrogated type I interferon response, in addition to a significant reduction of DNA damage markers. These results indicate that L1 activation contributes to the pathologies of SIRT6 knockout mice. Similarly, L1 transcription, cytoplasmic cDNA copy number, and type I interferons were elevated in the wild-type aged mice.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Since the dawn of the bioinformatics field, sequence alignment scores have been the main method for comparing sequences. However, alignment algorithms are quadratic, requiring long execution time. As alternatives, scientists have developed tens of alignment-free statistics for measuring the similarity between two sequences. RESULTS: We surveyed tens of alignment-free k-mer statistics. Additionally, we evaluated 33 statistics and multiplicative combinations between the statistics and/or their squares. These statistics are calculated on two k-mer histograms representing two sequences. Our evaluations using global alignment scores revealed that the majority of the statistics are sensitive and capable of finding similar sequences to a query sequence. Therefore, any of these statistics can filter out dissimilar sequences quickly. Further, we observed that multiplicative combinations of the statistics are highly correlated with the identity score. Furthermore, combinations involving sequence length difference or Earth Mover's distance, which takes the length difference into account, are always among the highest correlated paired statistics with identity scores. Similarly, paired statistics including length difference or Earth Mover's distance are among the best performers in finding the K-closest sequences. Interestingly, similar performance can be obtained using histograms of shorter words, resulting in reducing the memory requirement and increasing the speed remarkably. Moreover, we found that simple single statistics are sufficient for processing next-generation sequencing reads and for applications relying on local alignment. Finally, we measured the time requirement of each statistic. The survey and the evaluations will help scientists with identifying efficient alternatives to the costly alignment algorithm, saving thousands of computational hours.

	abstract = {Amino acids are the building blocks of protein, but also play important cellular signaling roles. The mechanisms through which altered levels of many amino acids are sensed and the signals transmitted are still largely unknown. Increasing evidence is showing that these signals may influence the aging process. In this regard, methionine restriction appears to be an evolutionary conserved mechanism to delay aging and supplementation with glycine can mimic methionine restriction to extend lifespan in rodents. Tryptophan restriction may also activate specific anti-aging pathways, but it could interfere with cognitive function. With exercise the consumption of dietary branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) may be beneficial in building muscle mass, but high levels of BCAAs as well as tyrosine and phenylalanine in the bloodstream are associated with metabolic disease such as insulin resistance. Individual supplementation or restriction of several different amino acids has shown promise in the treatment of insulin resistance in rodents. Much progress regarding the effects of amino acids on longevity has been made using yeast, nematodes, and fruit flies. Clearly, much more research is needed to understand the signaling pathways activated by amino acid imbalance before efficacious and well-tolerated dietary interventions can be developed for human aging and aging-related disorders. In this review the mechanisms through which altered dietary and cellular levels of the twenty proteogenic amino acids affect aging or aging-related disorders are discussed.},

Genes can shift expression as organisms evolve, but how ancestral expression influences altered descendant expression is not well understood. To examine this, we amalgamate 1,903 RNA-seq datasets from 182 research projects, including 6 organs in 21 vertebrate species. Quality control eliminates project-specific biases, and expression shifts are reconstructed using gene-family-wise phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. Expression shifts following gene duplication result in more drastic changes in expression properties than shifts without gene duplication. The expression properties are tightly coupled with protein evolutionary rate, depending on whether and how gene duplication occurred. Fluxes in expression patterns among organs are nonrandom, forming modular connections that are reshaped by gene duplication. Thus, if expression shifts, ancestral expression in some organs induces a strong propensity for expression in particular organs in descendants. Regardless of whether the shifts are adaptive or not, this supports a major role for what might be termed preadaptive pathways of gene expression evolution.},

AbLang restores the missing residues of antibody sequences better than using IMGT germlines or the general protein language model ESM-1b.

More importantly, SBTs enable other applications of increasing ambition, such as community wallet recovery, sybil-resistant governance, mechanisms for decentralization, and novel markets with decomposable, shared rights. We call this richer, pluralistic ecosystem “Decentralized Society” (DeSoc)—a co-determined sociality, where Souls and communities come together bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to co-create plural network goods and intelligences, at a range of scales. Key to this sociality is decomposable property rights and enhanced governance mechanisms—such as quadratic funding discounted by correlation scores—that reward trust and cooperation while protecting networks from capture, extraction, and domination.

	abstract = {CD9, a 24 kDa tetraspanin membrane protein, is known to regulate cell adhesion and migration, cancer progression and metastasis, immune and allergic responses, and viral infection. CD9 is upregulated in senescent endothelial cells, neointima hyperplasia, and atherosclerotic plaques. However, its role in cellular senescence and atherosclerosis remains undefined. We investigated the potential mechanism for CD9-mediated cellular senescence and its role in atherosclerotic plaque formation. CD9 knockdown in senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells significantly rescued senescence phenotypes, while CD9 upregulation in young cells accelerated senescence. CD9 regulated cellular senescence through a phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase-AKT-mTOR-p53 signal pathway. CD9 expression increased in arterial tissues from humans and rats with age, and in atherosclerotic plaques in humans and mice. Anti-mouse CD9 antibody noticeably prevented the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice and Ldlr-/- mice. Furthermore, CD9 ablation in ApoE-/- mice decreased atherosclerotic lesions in aorta and aortic sinus. These results suggest that CD9 plays critical roles in endothelial cell senescence and consequently the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, implying that CD9 is a novel target for prevention and treatment of vascular aging and atherosclerosis.},

We comprehensively compared 11 ONF metrics using several k-mer lengths for predicting host taxonomy from among ∼32 000 prokaryotic genomes for 1427 virus isolate genomes whose true hosts are known. The background-subtracting measure [Formula: see text] at k = 6 gave the highest host prediction accuracy (33\%, genus level) with reasonable computational times. Requiring a maximum dissimilarity score for making predictions (thresholding) and taking the consensus of the 30 most similar hosts further improved accuracy. Using a previous dataset of 820 bacteriophage and 2699 bacterial genomes, [Formula: see text] host prediction accuracies with thresholding and consensus methods (genus-level: 64\%) exceeded previous Euclidian distance ONF (32\%) or homology-based (22-62\%) methods. When applied to metagenomically-assembled marine SUP05 viruses and the human gut virus crAssphage, [Formula: see text]-based predictions overlapped (i.e. some same, some different) with the previously inferred hosts of these viruses. The extent of overlap improved when only using host genomes or metagenomic contigs from the same habitat or samples as the query viruses. The [Formula: see text] ONF method will greatly improve the characterization of novel, metagenomic viruses.},

Particularly, the checkpoint blockade approach has achieved great clinic success as evidenced by several U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-programmed death receptor 1/ligand 1 or anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 antibodies. However, the majority of cancers have low clinical response rates to these ICIs due to poor tumor immunogenicity. Indeed, the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes-TANK-binding kinase 1 (cGAS-STING-TBK1) axis is now appreciated as the major signaling pathway in innate immune response across different species. Aberrant signaling of this pathway has been closely linked to multiple diseases, including auto-inflammation, virus infection and cancers. In this perspective, we provide an updated review on the latest progress on the development of small molecule modulators targeting the cGAS-STING-TBK1 signaling pathway and their preclinical and clinical use as a new immune stimulatory therapy. Meanwhile, highlights on the clinical candidates, limitations and challenges, as well as future directions in this field are also discussed.

The model is as reliable as a human in describing odor quality: on a prospective validation set of 400 novel odorants, the model-generated odor profile more closely matched the trained panel mean (n=15) than did the median panelist. Applying simple, interpretable, theoretically-rooted transformations, the POM outperformed chemoinformatic models on several other odor prediction tasks, indicating that the POM successfully encoded a generalized map of structure-odor relationships. This approach broadly enables odor prediction and paves the way toward digitizing odors.

Unfortunately it is difficult to identify compounds that have unfavorable toxicity properties before conducting clinical trials. Inspired by the effective use of sabermetrics in predicting successful baseball players, we sought to use a similar “moneyball” approach that analyzes overlooked features to predict clinical toxicity. We introduce a new data-driven approach (PrOCTOR) that directly predicts the likelihood of toxicity in clinical trials. PrOCTOR integrates the properties of a compound's targets and its structure to provide a new measure, the PrOCTOR score. Drug target network connectivity and expression levels, along with molecular weight, were identified as important indicators of adverse clinical events. Our method provides a data-driven, broadly applicable strategy to identify drugs likely to possess manageable toxicity in clinical trials and will help drive the design of therapeutic agents with less toxicity.},

By carefully analyzing existing graph databases, we identify 3 critical components important for advancing the field of graph representation learning: (1) large graphs, (2) many graphs, and (3) class diversity. To date, no single graph database offers all these desired properties. We introduce MalNet, the largest public graph database ever constructed, representing a large-scale ontology of malicious software function call graphs. MalNet contains over 1.2 million graphs, averaging over 15k nodes and 35k edges per graph, across a hierarchy of 47 types and 696 families. Compared to the popular REDDIT-12K database, MalNet offers 105x more graphs, 39x larger graphs on average, and 63x more classes. We provide a detailed analysis of MalNet, discussing its properties and provenance, along with the evaluation of state-of-the-art machine learning and graph neural network techniques. The unprecedented scale and diversity of MalNet offers exciting opportunities to advance the frontiers of graph representation learning–enabling new discoveries and research into imbalanced classification, explainability and the impact of class hardness.

After binding and activation from dsDNA, cGAS uses ATP and GTP to synthesize 2', 3' -cGAMP (cGAMP), a cyclic dinucleotide second messenger with mixed 2'-5' and 3'-5' phosphodiester bonds. Inappropriate stimulation of cGAS has been implicated in autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, thus inhibition of cGAS may be of therapeutic benefit in some diseases; however, the size and polarity of the cGAS active site makes it a challenging target for the development of conventional substrate-competitive inhibitors. We report here the development of a high affinity (KD = 200 nM) inhibitor from a low affinity fragment hit with supporting biochemical and structural data showing these molecules bind to the cGAS active site. We also report a new high throughput cGAS fluorescence polarization (FP)-based assay to enable the rapid identification and optimization of cGAS inhibitors. This FP assay uses Cy5-labelled cGAMP in combination with a novel high affinity monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes cGAMP with no cross reactivity to cAMP, cGMP, ATP, or GTP. Given its role in the innate immune response, cGAS is a promising therapeutic target for autoinflammatory disease. Our results demonstrate its druggability, provide a high affinity tool compound, and establish a high throughput assay for the identification of next generation cGAS inhibitors.},

Upon binding double-stranded DNA, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase synthesizes a cyclic dinucleotide that initiates an inflammatory cellular response. Mouse studies that recapitulate causative mutations in the autoimmune disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome demonstrate that ablating the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase gene abolishes the deleterious phenotype. Here, we report the discovery of a class of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase inhibitors identified by a high-throughput screen. These compounds possess defined structure-activity relationships and we present crystal structures of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase, double-stranded DNA, and inhibitors within the enzymatic active site. We find that a chemically improved member, RU.521, is active and selective in cellular assays of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-mediated signaling and reduces constitutive expression of interferon in macrophages from a mouse model of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. RU.521 will be useful toward understanding the biological roles of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase and can serve as a molecular scaffold for development of future autoimmune therapies.Upon DNA binding cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) produces a cyclic dinucleotide, which leads to the upregulation of inflammatory genes.

Here we find that keratinocytes and other human cells mount an innate immune response within hours of etoposide-induced DNA damage, which involves the DNA sensing adaptor STING but is independent of the cytosolic DNA receptor cGAS. This non-canonical activation of STING is mediated by the DNA binding protein IFI16, together with the DNA damage response factors ATM and PARP-1, resulting in the assembly of an alternative STING signaling complex that includes the tumor suppressor p53 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. TRAF6 catalyzes the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains on STING, leading to the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and the induction of an alternative STING-dependent gene expression program.

To do so, we map this manifold to the product space of the degrees of freedom (translational, rotational, and torsional) involved in docking and develop an efficient diffusion process on this space.

Such a shift of perspective requires the adoption of a formal complex systems framework, a transition being facilitated by large-scale data collection and new analytical tools. Here, we provide a theoretical framework to orient researchers around key concepts for this transition, notably emergence, interaction networks and resilience. Drawing on evolutionary theory, network theory and principles of homeostasis, we propose that organismal function is accomplished by the integration of regulatory mechanisms at multiple hierarchical scales, and that the disruption of this ensemble causes the phenotypic and functional manifestations of aging. We present key examples at scales ranging from sub-organismal biology to clinical geriatrics, outlining how this approach can potentially enrich our understanding of aging.

However, we recently discovered the presence of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments that pinch off from intact nuclei of primary cells during senescence, a form of terminal cell-cycle arrest associated with pro-inflammatory responses. The functional significance of chromatin in the cytoplasm is unclear. Here we show that cytoplasmic chromatin activates the innate immunity cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase linked to stimulator of interferon genes) pathway, leading both to short-term inflammation to restrain activated oncogenes and to chronic inflammation that associates with tissue destruction and cancer. The cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway promotes the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in primary human cells and in mice. Mice deficient in STING show impaired immuno-surveillance of oncogenic RAS and reduced tissue inflammation upon ionizing radiation. Furthermore, this pathway is activated in cancer cells, and correlates with pro-inflammatory gene expression in human cancers. Overall, our findings indicate that genomic DNA serves as a reservoir to initiate a pro-inflammatory pathway in the cytoplasm in senescence and cancer. Targeting the cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated pathway may hold promise in treating inflammation-related disorders.},

	abstract = {Inappropriate activation or overactivation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) by double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) initiates a regulatory signaling cascade triggering a variety of inflammatory responses, which are a great threat to human health. This study focused on identifying the role of cGAS in atherosclerosis and its potential mechanisms. The relationship between cGAS and atherosclerosis was identified in an ApoE -/- mouse model. Meanwhile, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the underlying mechanisms of atherosclerosis in RAW264.7 macrophages treated with cGAS inhibition was conducted. Results showed that cGAS was positively correlated with atherosclerotic plaque area, and was mainly distributed in macrophages. RNA-seq analysis revealed that inflammatory response, immune response and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction may play important roles in the development of atherosclerosis. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results showed that the expression of the pro-inflammatory factors, signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat), interferon regulatory factor (Irf), toll-like receptors (Tlrs), and type I interferons (Ifns) were synergistically reduced when cGAS was inhibited. Furthermore, cGAS inhibition significantly inhibited RAW264.7 macrophage M1 polarization. These results demonstrate that cGAS may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis through synergistic inflammatory signaling of TLRs, STAT/IRF as well as IFNs, leading to macrophage M1 polarization.},

	abstract = {Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a genetic disorder caused by the lack of functional ATM kinase. A-T is characterized by chronic inflammation, neurodegeneration and premature ageing features that are associated with increased genome instability, nuclear shape alterations, micronuclei accumulation, neuronal defects and premature entry into cellular senescence. The causal relationship between the detrimental inflammatory signature and the neurological deficiencies of A-T remains elusive. Here, we utilize human pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical brain organoids to study A-T neuropathology. Mechanistically, we show that the cGAS-STING pathway is required for the recognition of micronuclei and induction of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in A-T olfactory neurosphere-derived cells and brain organoids. We further demonstrate that cGAS and STING inhibition effectively suppresses self-DNA-triggered SASP expression in A-T brain organoids, inhibits astrocyte senescence and neurodegeneration, and ameliorates A-T brain organoid neuropathology. Our study thus reveals that increased cGAS and STING activity is an important contributor to chronic inflammation and premature senescence in the central nervous system of A-T and constitutes a novel therapeutic target for treating neuropathology in A-T patients.},

	abstract = {This paper illustrates an approach to setting the decision framework for a study in early clinical drug development. It shows how the criteria for a go and a stop decision are calculated based on pre-specified target and lower reference values. The framework can lead to a three-outcome approach by including a consider zone; this could enable smaller studies to be performed in early development, with other information either external to or within the study used to reach a go or stop decision. In this way, Phase I/II trials can be geared towards providing actionable decision-making rather than the traditional focus on statistical significance. The example provided illustrates how the decision criteria were calculated for a Phase II study, including an interim analysis, and how the operating characteristics were assessed to ensure the decision criteria were robust.

	abstract = {Evidence-based quantitative methodologies have been proposed to inform decision-making in drug development, such as metrics to make go/no-go decisions or predictions of success, identified with statistical significance of future clinical trials. While these methodologies appropriately address some critical questions on the potential of a drug, they either consider the past evidence without predicting the outcome of the future trials or focus only on efficacy, failing to account for the multifaceted aspects of a successful drug development. As quantitative benefit-risk assessments could enhance decision-making, we propose a more comprehensive approach using a composite definition of success based not only on the statistical significance of the treatment effect on the primary endpoint but also on its clinical relevance and on a favorable benefit-risk balance in the next pivotal studies. For one drug, we can thus study several development strategies before starting the pivotal trials by comparing their predictive probability of success. The predictions are based on the available evidence from the previous trials, to which new hypotheses on the future development could be added. The resulting predictive probability of composite success provides a useful summary to support the discussions of the decision-makers. We present a fictive, but realistic, example in major depressive disorder inspired by a real decision-making case.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Generative machine learning (ML) has been postulated to be a major driver in the computational design of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb). However, efforts to confirm this hypothesis have been hindered by the infeasibility of testing arbitrarily large numbers of antibody sequences for their most critical design parameters: paratope, epitope, affinity, and developability. To address this challenge, we leveraged a lattice-based antibody-antigen binding simulation framework, which incorporates a wide range of physiological antibody binding parameters. The simulation framework enables both the computation of antibody-antigen 3D-structures as well as functions as an oracle for unrestricted prospective evaluation of the antigen specificity of ML-generated antibody sequences. We found that a deep generative model, trained exclusively on antibody sequence (1D) data can be used to design native-like conformational (3D) epitope-specific antibodies, matching or exceeding the training dataset in affinity and developability variety. Furthermore, we show that transfer learning enables the generation of high-affinity antibody sequences from low-N training data. Finally, we validated that the antibody design insight gained from simulated antibody-antigen binding data is applicable to experimental real-world data. Our work establishes a priori feasibility and the theoretical foundation of high-throughput ML-based mAb design.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
